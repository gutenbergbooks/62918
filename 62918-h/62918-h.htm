<p class="noindent">Geology, now deservedly one of the most
popular and attractive of the physical
sciences, was, not many years ago, held in
little estimation; and even at present, there
are not wanting some who do not hesitate
to maintain, that it is a mere tissue of ill observed
phenomena, and of hypotheses of
boundless extravagance. The work of <span class="smcap">Cuvier</span>
now laid before the public, contains in
itself not only a complete answer to these ignorant
imputations, but also demonstrates
the accuracy, extent, and importance of
many of the facts and reasonings of this de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>lightful
branch of Natural History. Can it
be maintained of a science, which requires for
its successful prosecution an intimate acquaintance
with Chemistry, Natural Philosophy
and Astronomy,&mdash;with the details and
views of Zoology, Botany, and Mineralogy,
and which connects these different departments
of knowledge in a most interesting
and striking manner,&mdash;that it is of no value?
Can it be maintained of Geology,
which discloses to us the history of the first
origin of organic beings, and traces their
<ins class="corr" id="tn-vi" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'gradual developement'">gradual development</ins> from the monade to
man himself,&mdash;which enumerates and describes
the changes that plants, animals, and
minerals&mdash;the atmosphere, and the waters
of the globe&mdash;have undergone from the earliest
geological periods up to our own time,
and which even instructs us in the earliest
history of the human species,&mdash;that it offers
no gratification to the philosopher? Can even
those who estimate the value of science, not
by intellectual desires, but by practical ad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>vantages,
deny the importance of Geology,
certainly one of the foundations of agriculture,
and which enables us to search out
materials for numberless important economical
purposes?</p>

<p>Geology took its rise in the Academy of
Freyberg, with the illustrious <span class="smcap">Werner</span>, to
whom we owe its present interesting condition.
This being the case, we ought not, (as is at
present too much the practice), amidst the
numerous discoveries in the mineral kingdom
which have been made since the system
of investigation of that great interpreter of
nature was made known, forget the master,
and arrogate all to ourselves. In this Island,
Geology first took firm root in the north:
in Edinburgh the Wernerian geognostical
views and method of investigation, combined
with the theory of <span class="smcap">Hutton</span>, the experiments
and speculations of <span class="smcap">Hall</span>, the illustrations
of <span class="smcap">Playfair</span>, and the labours of the Royal
and Wernerian Natural History Societies, ex<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>cited
a spirit of inquiry which rapidly spread
throughout the Empire; and now Great Britain
presents to the scientific world a scene
of geological acuteness, activity, and enterprise,
not surpassed in any other country.</p>

<p>On the Continent the writings of <span class="smcap">Cuvier</span>,
distinguished equally by purity and beauty
of style, and profound learning, have proved
eminently useful in aiding the progress of
Geology. In this country <span class="smcap">Cuvier</span> was first
made known as a geologist by the publication
of the present essay, which, from its unexampled
popularity, has made his name as familiar
to us as that of the most distinguished
of our own writers.</p>

<p class="p6 fs80 negin2">Fossil organic remains are the relics of a primeval world long since
gone past, proclaiming with a loud voice the instability of earthly
affairs, and impressing upon the minds of those who seriously consider
them, sentiments of piety and feelings of devotion. If the antiquary
digs from among the ruins of Herculaneum a piece of ancient
money, a vase, or a statue, we rejoice with him, in finding the
mode of life, the manners and arts of an ancient people, placed before
our eyes: If he finds an old record, illustrative of the history of his
country, however limited in extent that country may be, we are
grateful to him for the particle of knowledge he has added to our
store; but if, among the ruins of the common country of the human
race, we linger at the great sepulchre of animated beings destroyed
by the hand of fate, who can look upon it without sentiments
of piety! It is not here the statues of Polycletus that we admire,
but the admirable monuments of the workmanship of Nature, taken
from the ruins of the great Herculeum overwhelmed by the ocean,
that we look upon with feelings of the deepest wonder and devotion.</p>

<p class="noindent">The attention of naturalists was early directed
to the investigation of the fossil
organic remains so generally and abundantly
distributed throughout the strata of
which the crust of the Earth is composed.
It is not, as some writers now imagine, entirely
a modern study; for even so early as
the time of Leibnitz, we find that philosopher
drawing and describing fossil bones.
After this period it continued to interest
individuals, and engage the particular attention
of societies and academies. The
Royal Society of London, by the Memoirs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
of Sloane, Collinson, Lister, Derham, Baker,
Grew, Hunter, Jacobs, Plott, Camper, and
many others, afforded satisfactory proofs
of the importance attached to this branch
of Natural History by philosophers in England;
and the Memoirs of M. Graydon, in
the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy,
shew that it was not entirely neglected
in Ireland. On the continent of Europe the
natural history of petrifactions was also
much studied, as appears from the Memoirs
of Hollman, Beckman, and Blumenbach,
in the Transactions of the Royal Society of
Gottingen;&mdash;of Gmelin, Pallas, Herrmann,
Chappe, in the Memoirs of the Imperial
Academy of Sciences of Petersburg;&mdash;of
Geoffroi, Buffon, Daubenton, Faujas St
Fond, and others of the old French Academy
of Sciences;&mdash;of Astruc and Riviere,
of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Montpellier;&mdash;of
Collini of the Academia Theodoro-Palatina,
at Manheim, &amp;c. But the
geognostical relations of the rocks in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
these organic remains are contained were
but ill understood, until Werner pointed out
the mode of investigating them. His interesting
and important views were circulated
from Freyberg, by the writings and
conversations of his pupils, and have contributed
materially to the advancement of
this branch of Natural History in Germany,
France, and also in Great Britain. Petrifactions
are no longer viewed as objects
of mere curiosity, as things isolated and
unrelated to the rocks of which the crust
of the Earth is composed; on the contrary,
they are now considered as one of the most
important features in the strata of all regions
of the earth. By the regularity
and determinate nature of their distribution,
they afford characters which assist us
in discriminating not only single beds, but
also whole formations of rocks; and in this
respect they are highly interesting to the
geognostical inquirer. To the geologist this
beautiful branch of Natural History opens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
up numerous and uncommonly curious
views of nature in the mineral kingdom: it
shews him the commencement of the formation
of organic beings,&mdash;it points out the
gradual succession in the formation of animals,
from the almost primeval coral near
the primitive strata, through all the wonderful
variety of form and structure observed
in shells, fishes, amphibious animals, and
birds, to the perfect quadruped of the alluvial
land; and it makes him acquainted
with a geographical and physical distribution
of organic beings in the strata of the globe,
very different from what is observed to hold
in the present state of the organic world.
The zoologist views with wonder and
amazement those hosts of fossil animals,
sometimes so similar to the present living
species, at other times so far removed from
them in form and structure. He compares
the fossil orders, genera and species, with
those now inhabiting the earth’s surface, or
living in its waters, and discovers that there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
is a whole system of animals in a fossil
state different from the present. Even the
physiologist, in the various forms, connections,
and relations of the parts of those
animals, obtains new facts for his descriptions
and reasonings. Such, then, being the
nature of this branch of Natural History, it
is not surprising that, when once understood,
it should have many and zealous cultivators,
and occupy the talents of men of learning
and sagacity. In our time, Cuvier, the
celebrated Professor of Natural History in
Paris, has eminently distinguished himself
by his numerous discoveries, accurate descriptions,
and rational views, on this subject.
His great work on Fossil Organic Remains,
of which a new edition is now in progress,
is the most splendid contribution to
Natural History furnished by any individual
of this age.</p>

<p>The Essay on the Theory of the Earth,
now translated, is the introductory part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
the great work of Cuvier. The subject of
the <em>deluge</em> forms a principal object of this
elegant discourse. After describing the
principal results at which the theory of the
earth, in his opinion, has arrived, he next
mentions the various relations which connect
the history of the fossil bones of land
animals with these results; explains the
principles on which is founded the art of ascertaining
these bones, or, in other words,
of discovering a genus, and of distinguishing
a species, by a single fragment of bone:
and gives a rapid sketch of the results to
which his researches lead, of the new genera
and species which these have been the
means of discovering, and of the different
formations in which they are contained.
Some naturalists, as Lamarck, having maintained
that the present existing races of
quadrupeds are mere modifications or varieties
of those ancient races which we now
find in a fossil state, modifications which
may have been produced by change of cli<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>mate,
and other local circumstances, and
since brought to the present great difference,
by the operation of similar causes during a
long succession of ages,&mdash;Cuvier shews that
the difference between the fossil species and
those which now exist, is bounded by certain
limits; that these limits are a great
deal more extensive than those which now
distinguish the varieties of the same species,
and consequently, that the extinct species
of quadrupeds are not varieties of the presently
existing species. This very interesting
discussion naturally leads our author
to state the proofs of the recent population
of the world; of the comparatively modern
origin of its present surface; of the deluge,
and the subsequent renewal of human society.</p>

<p>In order to render this Essay more complete
and satisfactory, I have illustrated the
whole with an extensive series of observations,
and have arranged them in such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
manner that they will be readily accessible,
not only to the naturalist, but also to the
general reader.</p>

<p>Since the publication of the former edition
of this Essay, many curious discoveries
have been made in regard to fossil organic
remains:&mdash;some of these are included in the
Illustrations at the end of the Essay, others
want of room forces us to omit.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PRELIM">PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS.</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs150">I</span>n my work on Fossil Bones, the object which
I proposed was to discover to what animals the
osseous remains, with which the superficial strata
of the globe are filled, may have belonged.
In pursuing this object, I had to follow a path
in which but little progress had hitherto been
made. As an antiquary of a new order, I was
obliged at once to learn the art of restoring these
monuments of past revolutions to their original
forms, and to discover their nature and relations;
I had to collect and bring together in their original
order, the fragments of which they consisted;
to reconstruct, as it were, the ancient beings
to which these fragments belonged; to reproduce
them with all their proportions and characters;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
and, lastly, to compare them with those which
now live at the surface of the globe:&mdash;an art almost
unknown, and which presupposed a science
whose first developments had scarcely yet been
traced, that of the laws which regulate the co-existence
of the forms of the different parts in
organised beings. I had therefore to prepare myself
for these inquiries, by others of a far more
extensive kind, respecting the animals which still
exist. Nothing, except an almost complete review
of creation in its present state, could give a character
of demonstration to the results of my investigation
into its ancient state; but, from this
review, I had at the same time to expect a great
body of rules and affinities not less satisfactorily
demonstrated; and it became obvious, that, in
consequence of this essay upon a small portion of
the theory of the earth, the whole animal kingdom
would necessarily be in some measure subjected
to new laws.</p>

<p>Thus I was encouraged in this twofold investigation,
by the equal interest which it promised
to possess, both with regard to the general science
of anatomy, the essential basis of all those which
treat of organised bodies, and with regard to the
physical history of the globe, the foundation of
mineralogy, geography, and even, it may be said,
of the history of Man, and of all that it most concerns
him to know with regard to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>If it be so interesting to us to follow, in the
infancy of our species, the almost obliterated traces
of extinct nations, why should it not also be so,
to search, amid the darkness of the infancy of the
Earth, for the traces of revolutions which have taken
place anterior to the existence of all nations?
We admire the power by which the human mind
has measured the motions of the celestial bodies,
which nature seemed to have concealed for ever
from our view. Genius and science have burst
the limits of space; and observations, explained
by just reasoning, have unveiled the mechanism
of the universe. Would it not also be
glorious for man to burst the limits of time, and,
by means of observations, to ascertain the history
of this world, and the succession of events
which preceded the birth of the human race?
Astronomers have undoubtedly advanced more
rapidly than naturalists; and the present period,
with respect to the Theory of the Earth,
bears some resemblance to that in which some
philosophers fancied that the heavens were formed
of polished stones, and that the moon was of the
size <ins class="corr" id="tn-3" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'of the Peleponnesus'">
of the Peloponnesus</ins>; but after <span class="smcap">Anaxagoras</span>,
came <span class="smcap">Copernicus</span> and <span class="smcap">Kepler</span>, who
pointed the way to <span class="smcap">Newton</span>; and why should
not natural history also one day have its Newton?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Plan_of_this_Essay"><em>Plan of this Essay.</em></h2>
</div>


<p>What I especially propose to present in this
discourse, is the plan and the result of my labours
regarding Fossil Bones. I shall also attempt to
trace a rapid sketch of the efforts that have been
made up to the present day, to restore the history
of the revolutions of the globe. The facts which
I have been enabled to discover, form, without
doubt, only a small portion of those which would
be necessary to complete this ancient history; but
several of them lead to decisive consequences, and
the rigorous manner in which I have proceeded in
their determination, affords me reason to think
that they will be regarded as points definitively
fixed, and which in their aggregate will form an
epoch in science. Lastly, I trust their novelty
will be a sufficient excuse for me, if I claim for
them the earnest attention of my readers.</p>

<p>My object will first be to shew by what relations
the history of the fossil bones of terrestrial
animals connects itself with the theory of the
earth, and for what reasons a peculiar importance
is to be attributed to it, with reference to this
subject. I shall then unfold the principles upon
which is founded the art of determining these
bones, or, in other words, of recognizing a genus,
and of distinguishing a species, by a single fragment
of bone,&mdash;an art, on the certainty of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
depends that of my whole work, I shall give a
rapid account of the new species, and of genera
previously unknown, which the application of
these principles has led me to discover, as well as
the different kinds of deposits in which they are
contained. And as the difference between these
species and those which exist at the present day
is bounded by certain limits, I shall show that
these limits much exceed those which now distinguish
the varieties of the same species. I shall
therefore make known to what extent these varieties
may go, whether from the influence of time,
or from that of climate, or, lastly, from that of domestication.</p>

<p>In this way I shall be enabled to conclude, and
to induce my readers to conclude with me, that
great events were necessary to produce the more
considerable differences which I have discovered.
I shall next mention the particular modifications
which my researches must necessarily introduce
into the hitherto received opinions regarding
the revolutions of the globe; and, lastly, I
shall inquire how far the civil and religious history
of different nations corresponds with the results
of observation with regard to the physical
history of the Earth, and with the probabilities
which these observations afford concerning the
period at which societies of men may have found
fixed places of abode, and fields susceptible of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
cultivation, and at which, therefore, they may have
assumed a durable form.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="First_Appearance_of_the_Earth"><em>First Appearance of the Earth.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>When the traveller passes over those fertile
plains where gently flowing streams nourish in
their course an abundant vegetation, and where
the soil, inhabited by a numerous population,
adorned with flourishing villages, opulent cities,
and superb monuments, is never disturbed, except
by the ravages of war, or by the oppression of
the powerful, he is not led to suspect that Nature
also has had her intestine wars, and that the surface
of the globe has been broken up by revolutions
and catastrophes. But his ideas change as
soon as he digs into that soil which now presents
so peaceful an aspect, or ascends to the hills which
border the plain; his ideas are expanded, if I may
use the expression, in proportion to the expansion
of the view, and begin to embrace the full extent
and grandeur of those ancient events, when he
climbs the more elevated chains, whose base is
skirted by these hills, or when, by following the
beds of the torrents which descend from those
chains, he penetrates, as it were, into their interior.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="First_proofs_of_Revolutions"><em>First proofs of Revolutions on the surface of the Globe.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>The lowest and most level parts of the earth,
exhibit nothing, even when penetrated to a very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
great depth, but horizontal strata composed of substances
more or less varied, and containing almost
all of them innumerable marine productions. Similar
strata, with the same kind of productions,
compose the lesser hills to a considerable height.
Sometimes the shells are so numerous as to constitute
of themselves the entire mass of the rock;
they rise to elevations superior to the level of every
part of the ocean, and are found in places where
no sea could have carried them at the present day,
under any circumstances; they are not only enveloped
in loose sand, but are often inclosed in
the hardest rocks. Every part of the earth, every
hemisphere, every continent, every island of any
extent, exhibits the same phenomenon.</p>

<p>The times are past when ignorance could maintain,
that these remains of organized bodies are
mere sportings of nature, productions generated
in the womb of the Earth, by its own creative
powers; and the efforts made by some metaphysicians
of the present day, will not probably succeed
in bringing these exploded opinions again
into repute. A scrupulous comparison of the forms
of these remains, of their texture, and often even
of their chemical composition, does not disclose the
slightest difference between the fossil shells and
those which still inhabit the sea: the preservation
of the former is not less perfect than that of
the latter; most commonly we neither observe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
detrition nor fracture in them, nothing, in short,
that announces a violent removal from their
original places; the smallest of them retain
their sharpest ridges, and their most delicate
spines. They have, therefore, not only lived in
the sea, but they have also been deposited by it.
It is the sea which has left them in the places
where they are now found. But this sea has
remained for a certain period in those places;
it has covered them long enough, and with sufficient
tranquillity to form those deposits, so regular,
so thick, so extensive, and partly also so
solid, which contain those remains of aquatic animals.
The basin of the sea has therefore undergone
one change at least, either in extent, or in
situation. Such is the result of the very first
search, and of the most superficial examination.</p>

<p>The traces of revolutions become still more apparent
and decisive, when we ascend a little higher,
and approach nearer to the foot of the great
chains. There are still found many beds of shells;
some of these are even thicker and more solid;
the shells are quite as numerous, and as well preserved,
but they are no longer of the same species.
The strata which contain them are not so
generally horizontal; they assume an oblique position,
and are sometimes almost vertical. While
in the plains and low hills it was necessary to
dig deep, in order to discover the succession of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
beds, we here discover it at once by their exposed
edges, as we follow the valleys that have been
produced by their disjunction. Great masses
of debris form at the foot of the cliffs, rounded
hills, the height of which is augmented by every
thaw and tempest.</p>

<p>These inclined strata, which form the ridges
of the secondary mountains, do not rest upon
the horizontal strata of the hills which are situate
at their base, and which form the first steps
in approaching them; but, on the contrary, dip
under them, while the hills in question rest upon
their declivities. When we dig through the
horizontal strata in the vicinity of mountains
whose strata are inclined, we find these inclined
strata re-appearing below; and even sometimes,
when the inclined strata are not too elevated, their
summit is crowned by horizontal ones<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. The inclined
strata are therefore older than the horizontal
strata; and as they must necessarily, at
least the greater number of them, have been
formed in a horizontal position, it is evident that
they have been raised<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, and that this change in
their direction has been effected before the others
were superimposed upon them<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>Thus the sea, previous to the deposition of the
horizontal strata, had formed others, which, by the
operation of problematical causes, were broken,
raised, and overturned in a thousand ways; and, as
several of those inclined strata which it had formed
at more remote periods, rise higher than the horizontal
strata which have succeeded them, and
which surround them, the causes by which the
inclination of these beds was effected, had also
made them project above the level of the sea, and
formed islands of them, or at least shoals and inequalities;
and this must have happened, whether
they had been raised by one extremity, or whether
the depression of the opposite extremity had
made the waters subside. This is the second result,
not less clear, nor less satisfactorily demonstrated,
than the first, to every one who will take
the trouble of examining the monuments on which
it is established.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Proofs_that_such_revolutions"><em>Proofs that such revolutions have been numerous.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>But it is not to this subversion of the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
strata, nor to this retreat of the sea after the formation
of the new strata, that the revolutions
and changes which have given rise to the present
state of the Earth are limited.</p>

<p>When we institute a more detailed comparison
between the various strata and those remains
of animals which they contain, we presently perceive,
that this ancient sea has not always deposited
mineral substances of the same kind, nor remains
of animals of the same species; and that
each of its deposits has not extended over the
whole surface which it covered. There has existed
a succession of variations; the former of
which alone have been more or less general, while
the others appear to have been much less so. The
older the strata are, the more uniform is each of
them over a great extent; the newer they are, the
more limited are they, and the more subject to
vary at small distances. Thus the displacements
of the strata were accompanied and followed by
changes in the nature of the fluid, and of the
matters which it held in solution; and when certain
strata, by making their appearance above the
waters, had divided the surface of the seas by
islands and projecting ridges, different changes
might take place in particular basins.</p>

<p>Amidst these variations in the nature of the
general fluid, it is evident, that the animals which
lived in it could not remain the same. Their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
species, and even their genera, changed with the
strata; and, although the same species occasionally
recur at small distances, it may be announced
as a general truth, that the shells of the ancient
strata have forms peculiar to themselves; that
they gradually disappear, so as no longer to be
seen at all in the recent strata, and still less in
the presently existing ocean, in which their corresponding
species are never discovered, and where
several, even of their genera, do not occur: that,
on the contrary, the shells of the recent strata are
similar, in respect to their genera, to those which
exist in our seas; and that, in the latest and least
consolidated of these strata, and in certain recent
and limited deposits, there are some species which
the most experienced eye could not distinguish
from those which are found in the neighbouring
seas.</p>

<p>There has, therefore, been a succession of variations
in the economy of organic nature, which
has been occasioned by those of the fluid in which
the animals lived, or which has at least corresponded
with them; and these variations have
gradually conducted the classes of aquatic animals
to their present state, till, at length, at the
time when the sea retired from our continents for
the last time, its inhabitants did not differ much
from those which are found in it at the present
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>We say for the <em>last</em> time, because, if we examine
with still greater care those remains of organised
bodies, we discover, in the midst of even
the oldest strata of marine formation, other strata
replete with animal or vegetable remains of terrestrial
or fresh-water productions; and, amongst
the more recent strata, or, in other words, those
that are nearest the surface, there are some in
which land animals are buried under heaps of marine
productions. Thus, the various catastrophes
which have disturbed the strata, have not only
caused the different parts of our continents to rise
by degrees from the bosom of the waves, and diminished
the extent of the basin of the ocean, but
have also given rise to numerous shiftings of this
basin. It has frequently happened, that lands
which have been laid dry, have been again covered
by the waters, in consequence either of their being
ingulphed in the abyss, or of the sea having
merely risen over them. The particular portions
also, of the Earth, which the sea abandoned in its
last retreat,&mdash;those which are now inhabited by
man and terrestrial animals,&mdash;had already been
once laid dry, and had then afforded subsistence
to quadrupeds, birds, plants, and land productions
of all kinds: the sea which left it had,
therefore, covered it at a previous period<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>The changes in the level of the waters have
not, therefore, consisted solely in a more or less
gradual, or more or less general retreat; there
have been various successive irruptions and retreats,
the final result of which, however, has been
a universal depression of the level of the sea.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Proofs_that_these_Revolutions"><em>Proofs that these Revolutions have been sudden.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>It is of much importance to remark, that
these repeated irruptions and retreats of the
sea have neither all been slow nor gradual; on
the contrary, most of the catastrophes which have
occasioned them have been sudden; and this is
especially easy to be proved, with regard to the
last of these catastrophes, that which, by a two-fold
motion, has inundated, and afterwards laid
dry, our present continents, or at least a part
of the land which forms them at the present
day. In the northern regions, it has left the carcases
of large quadrupeds which became enveloped
in the ice, and have thus been preserved even to
our own times, with their skin, their hair, and
their flesh. If they had not been frozen as soon
as killed, they would have been decomposed by
putrefaction. And, on the other hand, this eternal
frost could not previously have occupied the
places in which they have been seized by it, for
they could not have lived in such a temperature.
It was, therefore, at one and the same moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
that these animals were destroyed, and the country
which they inhabited became covered with ice.
This event has been sudden, instantaneous, without
any gradation; and what is so clearly demonstrated
with respect to this last catastrophe, is not
less so with reference to those which have preceded
it. The breaking to pieces, the raising up
and overturning of the older strata, leave no doubt
upon the mind that they have been reduced to
the state in which we now see them, by the action
of sudden and violent causes; and even the force
of the motions excited in the mass of waters, is
still attested by the heaps of debris and rounded
pebbles which are in many places interposed between
the solid strata. Life, therefore, has often
been disturbed on this earth by terrible events.
Numberless living beings have been the victims
of these catastrophes; some, which inhabited the
dry land, have been swallowed up by inundations;
others, which peopled the waters, have been laid
dry, from the bottom of the sea having been suddenly
raised; their very races have been extinguished
for ever, and have left no other memorial
of their existence than some fragments, which the
naturalist can scarcely recognize.</p>

<p>Such are the conclusions to which we are necessarily
led by the objects that we meet with at
every step, and which we can always verify, by examples
drawn from almost every country. These<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
great and terrible events are every where distinctly
recorded, so as to be always legible by the eye
skilled to decypher their history in the monuments
which they have left behind.</p>

<p>But what is still more astonishing and not less
certain, <em>life</em> has not always existed upon the
globe; and it is easy for the observer to distinguish
the point at which it has begun to deposit
its productions.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Proofs_that_there_have_been_Revolutions"><em>Proofs that there have been Revolutions anterior to the
existence of living beings.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>If we ascend to higher points of elevation, and
advance towards the great ridges, the craggy summits
of the mountain chains, we shall presently
find those remains of marine animals, those innumerable
shells, of which we have spoken, becoming
more rare, and at length disappearing altogether.
We arrive at strata of a different nature,
which contain no vestiges of living beings.
Nevertheless, their crystallization, and even their
stratification, shew that they have been also in a
liquid state at their formation; their inclined position,
and the cliffs into which they are broken,
shew that they also have been forcibly moved from
their original places; the oblique manner in
which they dip under the shelly strata, that they
have been formed previously to these latter; and
lastly, the height to which their rugged and bare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
peaks rise above all these shelly strata, that their
summits had already emerged from the waters,
when the shelly strata were forming.</p>

<p>Such are those celebrated Primitive Mountains
which traverse our continents in different directions,
raising themselves above the clouds, separating
the basins of rivers from one another, affording,
in their perennial snows, reservoirs which
feed the springs, and forming, in some measure, the
skeleton, and as it were the rough framework, of
the Earth.</p>

<p>The eye perceives from afar, in the indentations
with which their ridge has been marked,
and in the sharp peaks with which it is bristled,
indications of the violent manner in which they
have been elevated. Their appearance, in this respect,
is very different from that of those rounded
mountains, and hills with long flat surfaces, whose
less ancient masses have always remained in the
situation in which they were quietly deposited by
the waters of more recent seas.</p>

<p>These indications become more obvious as we
approach. The valleys have no longer those
gently-sloping sides, those salient and re-entering
angles corresponding on either side to each other,
which seem to denote the beds of ancient streams.
They widen and they contract without any general
rule; their waters, at one time, expand into
lakes; at another, fall in torrents; and some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>times
their rocks, suddenly approaching from each
side, form transverse dikes, over which the waters
tumble in cataracts. The dissevered strata, while
they shew on one side their edges perpendicularly
raised, on the other present large portions of
their surface lying obliquely; they do not correspond
in height, but those which, on one side,
form the summit of the cliff, often dip underneath
on the other, and are no longer visible.</p>

<p>Yet, amidst all this confusion, distinguished
naturalists have been able to demonstrate, that
there still reigns a certain order, and that those
immense deposits, broken and overturned though
they be, observe a regular succession with regard
to each other, which is nearly the same in all the
great mountain chains. According to them, Granite,
of which the central ridges of the greater
number of these chains consist, and which thus
surmounts every other rock, is also the rock which
is found deepest in the solid crust of the globe.
It is the most ancient of those which we have
found means of examining in the place assigned
them by nature; and we inquire not at present,
whether it owes its origin to a general fluid, which
formerly held every thing in solution, or may have
been the first consolidated by the cooling of a
great mass in fusion, or even in a state of vapour<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Foliated rocks rest upon its sides, and form the
lateral ridges of these great chains; schists, porphyries,
sandstones, and talcose rocks, intermingle
with their strata; lastly, granular marbles, and
other limestones destitute of shells, resting upon
the schists, form the outer ridges, the lower steps
as it were, the counterforts, of these chains, and
are the last formations, by which this unknown
fluid, this sea without inhabitants, would seem to
have prepared materials for the mollusca and zoophytes,
which were presently to deposite upon
these foundations vast heaps of their shells and
corals.</p>

<p>We even find the first productions of these
mollusca and zoophytes appearing in small numbers,
and scattered at greater or less distances,
in the last strata of these primitive formations, or
in that portion of the crust of the globe to which
geologists have given the name of Transition rocks.
Here and there we meet with beds containing
shells, interposed between certain granites of later<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
formation than the others, between schists of various
kinds, and between some newer beds of granular
marbles. Life, which was in the end to
obtain entire possession of the globe, seems, in
these primordial times, to have struggled with
the inert nature which formerly predominated;
and it was not until a considerable time after, that
it obtained the ascendancy over it, and acquired
for itself the exclusive right of continuing and elevating
the solid envelope of the Earth.</p>

<p>Hence, it is impossible to deny, that the masses
which now constitute our highest mountains,
have been originally in a liquid state; and that
they have for a long time been covered by waters
in which no living beings existed. Thus, it has
not been only since the appearance of life that
changes have been operated in the nature of the
matters which have been deposited; for the masses
formed previous to that event, have varied,
as well as those which have been formed since.
They have also experienced violent changes in
their position, and a part of these changes must
have taken place at the period when these masses
existed by themselves, and were not covered over
by the shelly masses. The proof of this lies in
the overturnings, the disruptions, and the fissures,
which are observable in their strata, as well as
in those of more recent formations, and which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
are in the ancient strata even in greater number
and better defined.</p>

<p>But these primitive masses have also undergone
other revolutions since the formation of the
secondary strata, and have, perhaps, given rise
to, or at least have partaken of, some of those
changes which these strata themselves have experienced.
There are actually considerable portions
of the primitive formations uncovered, although
placed in lower situations than many of the secondary
formations; and we cannot conceive how it
should have so happened, unless the primitive
strata in those places had forced themselves into
view, after the secondary strata had been formed.
In certain countries, we find numerous large blocks
of primitive substances scattered over the surface
of secondary <ins class="corr" id="tn-21" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'formations, aud'">
formations, and</ins> separated by deep
valleys, or even by arms of the sea, from the peaks
or ridges from which they must have been derived.
We must necessarily conclude, therefore, either
that these blocks have been ejected by eruptions,
or that the valleys (which must have stopped their
course) did not exist at the time of their being
transported; or, lastly, that the motions of the
waters by which they were transported, exceeded
in violence any thing that we can imagine at the
present day<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>Here, therefore, we have a collection of facts, a
series of epochs, anterior to the present time, of
which the successive steps may be perfectly ascertained,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
although the duration of their intervals
cannot be defined with precision. They are so
many fixed points, which serve to regulate and direct
our inquiries respecting this ancient chronology.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Examination_of_the_Causes"><em>Examination of the Causes which act at present on the
surface of the Globe.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>Let us now examine those changes which are
taking place at the present day upon the globe, investigating
the causes which still act in its surface,
and endeavouring to determine the possible extent
of their effects. This portion of the history of the
Earth is so much the more important, that it has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
long been considered possible to explain the more
ancient revolutions on its surface by means of these
still existing causes; in the same manner as it is
found easy to explain past events in political history,
by an acquaintance with the passions and
intrigues of the present day. But we shall presently
see, that unfortunately the case is different
in physical history:&mdash;the thread of operations is
here broken; the march of Nature is changed;
and none of the agents which she now employs,
would have been sufficient for the production of
her ancient works.</p>

<p>There still exist, however, four causes in full
activity, which contribute to alter the surface of
our continents. These are, rains and thaws, which
waste down the steep mountains, and precipitate
the fragments to their bottoms; running waters,
which carry off these fragments, and deposit them
in places where their current is abated; the sea,
which undermines the foundations of elevated
coasts, forming steep cliffs, and which throws up
great banks of sand upon the low coasts; and, lastly,
volcanoes, which pierce through the solid strata
from below, elevate these strata, or spread over the
surface vast quantities of ejected matter<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Of_Slips_or_Falling"><em>Of Slips, or Falling down of the Materials of
Mountains.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>In every place where the broken strata present
their edges on abrupt surfaces, there fall down to
their base, every spring, and even after every
storm, fragments of their materials, which are
rounded by rolling upon each other. These collected
heaps gradually assume an inclination determined
by the laws of cohesion, and thus form, at the
bottom of the cliff, taluses, of greater or less elevation,
according as the fragments which have fallen
are more or less abundant. These taluses
constitute the sides of the valleys in all elevated,
mountainous regions, and are covered with a rich
vegetation, whenever the fragments from the upper
parts begin to fall less abundantly; but their
want of solidity subjects themselves also to slips,
when they are undermined by rivulets. On
these occasions, towns, and rich and populous districts,
are sometimes buried under the ruins of a
mountain; the courses of rivers are interrupted,
and lakes are formed in places which were before
the abodes of fertility and cheerfulness. Fortunately
these great slips happen but seldom, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
the principal use of those hills of debris, is to furnish
materials for the ravages of torrents.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Alluvial_Formations"><em>Alluvial Formations<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>The rains which fall, the vapours which are
condensed, and the snows which are melted, upon
the ridges and summits of mountains, descend,
by an infinite number of rills, along their
slopes, carrying with them some portions of the
materials of which these slopes are composed, and
tracing slight furrows by their passage. These
rills soon unite in the deeper gutters with which
the surface is marked, run off by the deep valleys
which intersect their bottom, and thus form streams
and rivers, which carry back to the sea the waters
it had formerly supplied to the atmosphere. On
the melting of the snows, or when a storm takes
place, these mountain torrents become suddenly
swollen, and rush down the declivities with a velocity
proportioned to their steepness. They dash
violently against the bases of those taluses of
fallen fragments which cover the sides of all the
high valleys, carrying off the already rounded
fragments of which they are composed, and which
thus become smoothed, and still farther polished,
by attrition. But in proportion as
they reach the more level valleys, where their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
violence is diminished, or when they arrive at
more expanded basins, where their waters are
permitted to spread, they throw out upon their
banks the largest of those stones which they had
rolled down. The smaller fragments are deposited
still lower; and nothing reaches the great
canal of the river excepting the minutest particles,
or the most impalpable mud. It often
happens, also, that before these streams unite to
form great rivers, they have to pass through large
and deep lakes, in which their mud is deposited,
and from which their waters come forth limpid.</p>

<p>The lower rivers, and all the streams which
descend from the less elevated mountains and hills,
also produce effects, upon the districts through
which they flow, more or less analogous to those
of the torrents from the higher mountains. When
these rivers are swollen by great rains, they attack
the base of the earthy or sandy hills which they
meet with in their course, and carry their fragments
to be deposited upon the lower grounds, and which
are thus, in some degree, raised by each succeeding
inundation. Finally, when the rivers reach
great lakes or the sea, and when that rapidity,
which carried off and kept in suspension the particles
of mud comes to cease entirely, these particles
are deposited at the sides of their mouths,
where they form low grounds, by which the shores
are prolonged. And if these shores are such, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the sea also throws up sand upon them, and thus
contributes to their increase; there are created,
as it were, provinces, and even entire kingdoms,
which usually become the most fertile, and speedily
the richest, in the world, if their rulers permit
human industry to exert itself in peace.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Formation_of_Downs"><em>Formation of Downs.</em><a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></h2>
</div>

<p>The effects which the sea produces, without
the co-operation of rivers, are much less beneficial.
When the coast is low, and the bottom
sandy, the waves push the sand toward the shore,
where, at every reflux of the tide, it becomes partially
dried; and the wind, which almost always
blows from the sea, drifts it upon the beach.
Thus are formed those hillocks of sand, named
Downs, which, if the industry of man does not
fix them by suitable plants, move slowly, but invariably,
toward the interior of the country, and
overwhelm fields and dwellings, because the
same wind that raises the sand of the beach upon
the down, throws that of its summit in the opposite
direction from the sea. When the nature
of the sand, and that of the water which is raised
with it, are such as to form a durable cement,
the shells and bones, thrown upon the beach, become
incrusted with it. Pieces of wood, trunks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
of trees, and plants growing near the sea, are enveloped
in these aggregates; and thus are produced
what might be denominated <em>indurated
downs</em>, such as we see upon the coasts of New
Holland, and of which a precise idea may be
formed from the description given of them by
Peron<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Formation_of_Cliffs"><em>Formation of Cliffs or Steep Shores.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, when the coast is high, the
sea, which is thus prevented from throwing up
any thing, exercises a destructive action upon it.
Its waves, by sapping the foundation, cause the
superincumbent portion of the face of the cliff,
thus deprived of support, to be incessantly falling
down in fragments. These fragments are tumbled
about by the billows, until the softer and more divided
parts disappear. The harder portions, from
being rolled in contrary directions, assume the
form of boulders and pebbles; and these, at length,
accumulate in sufficient quantity to form a rampart,
by which the bottom of the cliff is protected
against farther depredations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such is the action of water upon the solid land;
and we see, that it consists almost entirely in reducing
it to lower levels, but not indefinitely.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
The fragments of the great mountain ridges are
carried down into the valleys; their finer particles,
together with those of the lower hills and
plains, are borne to the sea; alluvial depositions
extend the coasts at the expence of the high
grounds. These are limited effects, to which vegetation
in general puts a stop, and which, besides,
presuppose the existence of mountains, valleys,
and plains, in short, all the inequalities of the
globe; and which, therefore, cannot have given
rise to these inequalities. The formation of downs
is a phenomenon still more limited, both in regard
to height and horizontal extent; and has no relation
whatever to that of those enormous masses
into the origin of which it is the object of geology
to inquire.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Depositions_formed_in_Water"><em>Depositions formed in Water.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>Although we cannot obtain a precise knowledge
of the action exerted by water within its own
bosom, it is yet possible to determine its limits to
a certain degree.</p>

<p>Lakes, pools, marshes, and sea-ports, into which
rivulets discharge their waters, more especially
when these descend from near and steep hills, deposit
large quantities of mud, which would at
length fill them up entirely, if care were not taken
to clean them out. The sea also throws quanti<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>ties
of slime and sediment into harbours and
creeks; into all places, in short, where its waters
are more tranquil than ordinary. The currents
also heap up at their meeting, or throw out at
their sides, the sand which they are continually
raising from the bottom of the sea, forming it into
banks and shallows.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Stalactites"><em>Stalactites.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>Certain waters, after dissolving calcareous substances
by means of the superabundant carbonic
acid with which they are impregnated, allow these
substances to crystallize after the acid has evaporated;
and, in this manner, form stalactites, and
other concretions. There are strata, confusedly
crystallized in fresh water, which are sufficiently
extensive to be compared with some of those
which have been deposited by the ancient sea.
The famous Travertine quarries of the neighbourhood
of Rome, and the rocks of the same substance,
which are formed, and continually varied
in figure, by the river of Teverona, are generally
known. These two modes of action may be combined;
the deposits accumulated by the sea may
be solidified by stalactite. Thus, when springs
abounding in calcareous matter, or containing
some other substance in solution, happen to fall
into places where these deposits are formed, we then
find aggregates in which marine and fresh-water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
productions may be blended. Of this description
are the banks in the island of Guadeloupe, which,
along with human skeletons, present land and sea
shells mingled together. Of the same nature
also is the quarry described by Saussure, in the
neighbourhood of Messina, in which the sandstone
is seen forming by the consolidation of the
sand thrown up by the sea.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Lithophytes"><em>Lithophytes.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>In the torrid zone, where lithophytes of many
species abound, and are propagated with great rapidity,
their strong trunks are interwoven and accumulated
so as to form rocks and reefs; and
rising even to the surface of the water, shut up the
entrance of harbours, and lay frightful snares for
navigators. The sea, throwing up sand and mud
upon the tops of these shoals, sometimes raises
their surface above its own level, and forms islands,
which are soon covered with a rich vegetation.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Incrustation"><em>Incrustation.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>It is also possible, that, in particular places, large
quantities of the animals inhabiting shells, leave
their stony coverings when they die, and that these,
cemented together by slime of greater or less consistence,
or by other cementing substances, form
extensive deposits or shell banks. But we have no
evidence that the sea can now incrust those shells<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
with a paste as compact as that of the marbles,
the sandstones, or even the coarse limestone
(calcaire grossier) in which we see the shells of
our strata enveloped. Still less do we any where
find the sea depositing those more solid and more
siliceous strata which have preceded the formation
of the shelly strata.</p>

<p>In short, all these causes united, would not
change, in an appreciable degree, the level of the
sea; nor raise a single stratum above its surface;
and still less would they produce the smallest
hillock upon the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>It has been asserted that the sea has undergone
a general diminution of level; and proofs of this are
said to have been discovered in some parts of the
shores of the Baltic.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But whatever may be the
causes of these appearances, we are certain that they
are not general in their operation; and that, in the
greater number of harbours, where any alteration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
of the level would be a matter of so much interest,
and where fixed and ancient works afford
so many means of measuring its variations, the
mean level of the sea is constant. There has,
therefore, never been a universal lowering, nor a
universal encroachment, of the waters of the ocean.
In some places, indeed, such as Scotland, and various
parts of the Mediterranean, evidence has
been thought to have been found, that the sea
has risen, and that it now covers shores which
were formerly above its level<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Volcanoes"><em>Volcanoes.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>The action of volcanoes is still more limited, and
more local, than any of those which have yet been
mentioned. Although we have no precise idea of
the means by which nature keeps up these violent
fires at such great depths, we can judge decidedly,
by their effects, of the changes which they may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
have produced at the surface of the globe. After
a volcano has announced itself, by some shocks of
an earthquake, it forms for itself an opening.
Stones and ashes are thrown to a great distance,
and lava is vomited forth. The more fluid part of
the lava flows in long streams, while the less fluid
portion stops at the edges of the opening, raises its
margins all round, and forms a cone, terminated by
a crater. Thus volcanoes accumulate upon the surface
matters which were previously buried in the
bowels of the earth, after modifying their nature,
and raise themselves into mountains. By these
means, they have formerly covered some parts of
our continent, and have also suddenly produced
islands in the middle of the sea. But these mountains
and islands have always been composed of
lava, and all their materials have undergone the
action of fire: they are disposed as matters should
be, which have flowed from an elevated point.
Volcanoes, therefore, neither raise nor overturn
the strata through which their apertures pass;
and if some causes acting from those depths have
contributed, in certain cases, to raise up large
mountains, they cannot have been volcanic agents
of the same nature as those which exist at the
present day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus, we repeat, it is in vain that we search,
among the powers which now act at the surface of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
the earth, for causes sufficient to produce the revolutions
and catastrophes, the traces of which are
exhibited by its crust: And if we have recourse to
the constant external forces with which we are as
yet acquainted, we shall have no greater success.</p>

<p>The pole of the earth moves in a circle around
the pole of the ecliptic, and its axis is more or less
inclined to the plane of the ecliptic; but these two
motions, the causes of which are now ascertained,
are much too limited for the production of effects
like those whose magnitude we have just been
stating. At any rate, their excessive slowness
would render them altogether inadequate to account
for catastrophes which, as we have shewn,
must have been sudden.</p>

<p>The same reasoning applies to all other slow
motions which have been conceived as causes of
the revolutions in question, chosen doubtless in
the hope that their existence could not be denied,
because it might always be easy to hold out
that their very slowness rendered them imperceptible.
But whether they be true or not is of little
importance, for they explain nothing, as no
cause acting slowly could have produced sudden
effects.</p>

<p>Admitting that there has been a gradual diminution
of the waters; that the sea has transported
solid matters in all directions; that the tem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>perature
of the globe is either diminishing or increasing;&mdash;none
of these causes could have overturned
our strata; enveloped in ice large animals,
with their flesh and skin; laid dry marine
testacea, the shells of which are, at the present
day, as well preserved as if they had been drawn
up alive from the sea; and, lastly, destroyed numerous
species, and even entire genera.</p>

<p>These considerations have struck most naturalists;
and among those who have endeavoured to
explain the present state of the globe, hardly any
one has attributed it entirely to the agency of slow
causes, still less to causes operating under our
eyes. The necessity to which they are thus reduced,
of seeking for causes different from those
which we see acting at the present day, is the very
circumstance that has forced them to make so
many extraordinary suppositions, and to lose
themselves in so many erroneous and contradictory
speculations, that the very name of their
science, as I have elsewhere remarked, has long
been a subject of ridicule to prejudiced persons,
who have only looked to the systems which it has
been the means of hatching, and have forgotten
the extensive and important series of authentic
facts which it has brought to light<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Older_Systems_of_Geologists"><em>Older Systems of Geologists.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>During a long time, two events or epochs only,
the Creation and the Deluge, were admitted as
comprehending the changes which have been operated
upon the globe; and all the efforts of geologists
were directed to account for the present
existing state of things, by imagining a certain
original state, afterwards modified by the deluge,
of which also, as to its causes, its operations, and
its effects, each entertained his own theory.</p>

<p>Thus, according to one<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, the earth was at first
invested with an uniform light crust, which covered
the abyss of the sea; and which being broken
up for the production of the deluge, formed the
mountains by its fragments. According to another<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>,
the deluge was occasioned by a momentary
suspension of cohesion among the particles of mineral
bodies; the whole mass of the globe was dissolved,
and the paste thus formed became penetrated
with shells. According to a third<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>, God raised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
up the mountains for the purpose of allowing the
waters, which had produced the deluge, to run
off; and selected those places in which there was
the greatest quantity of rocks, without which the
mountains could not have supported themselves.
A fourth<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> created the earth from the atmosphere
of one comet, and deluged it by the tail of another:
The heat which it retained from its origin,
was what, in his opinion, excited the whole of the
living beings upon it to sin; for which they were
all drowned, excepting the fishes, whose passions
were apparently less vehement.</p>

<p>It is evident, that, even while confined within
the limits prescribed by the Book of Genesis,
naturalists might still have a pretty wide range:
they soon found themselves, however, in too narrow
bounds; and when they had succeeded in
converting the six days of creation into so many
indefinite periods, the lapse of ages no longer
forming an obstacle to their views, their systems
took a flight proportioned to the periods which
they could then dispose of at pleasure.</p>

<p>Even the great Leibnitz amused himself, like
Descartes, by conceiving the earth to be an extinguished
sun<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, a vitrified globe, upon which the
vapours falling down again, after it had cooled,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
formed seas, which afterwards deposited the limestone
formations.</p>

<p>By Demaillet the whole globe was conceived
to have been covered with water for many thousands
of years. He supposed this water had gradually
retired; that all the land animals were originally
inhabitants of the sea; that man himself
commenced his career as a fish; and he asserts,
that it is not uncommon, even now, to meet with
fishes in the ocean, which are still only half converted
into men, but whose descendants will in
time become perfect human beings<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p>The system of Buffon is merely an extension
of that of Leibnitz, with the addition only of a
comet, which, by a violent blow, struck off from
the sun the liquefied mass of the earth, together
with those of all the other planets at the same
instant. From this supposition, he was enabled
to assume positive dates, as, from the present temperature
of the earth, it could be calculated how
long it had taken to cool down so far; and, as all
the other planets had come from the sun at the
same time, it could also be calculated how many
ages are still required for cooling the greater
ones, and to what degree the smaller are already
frozen<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="More_recent_Systems"><em>More recent Systems.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>In our own times, men of still bolder imaginations
have exercised their minds upon this great
subject. Some writers have revived and greatly
extended the ideas of Demaillet. They suppose
that every thing was originally fluid; that this
fluid gave existence to animals, which were at
first of the most simple kind, such as the monads
and other infusory and microscopic species; that,
in process of time, and by assuming different habits,
the races of animals became complicated, and
assumed that diversity of nature and character
in which they now appear. By means of those
various races of animals, part of the waters of the
sea have gradually been converted into calcareous
earth; while the vegetables, concerning the origin
and metamorphoses of which these writers are
totally silent, have, on their part, converted a portion
of the same water into clay: These two
earths, on being stripped of the characters which
life had impressed upon them, are resolved, by a
final analysis, into silex; and hence the reason
that the oldest mountains are more siliceous than
the rest. All the solid parts of the earth, therefore,
owe their existence to life, and, without life,
the globe would still be entirely liquid<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>Other writers have preferred the ideas of Kepler,
and, like that great astronomer, have considered
the globe itself as possessed of vital faculties.
According to them a vital fluid circulates in
it; a process of assimilation goes on in it, as well as
in animated bodies; every particle of it is alive;
it possesses instinct and volition, even to the most
elementary molecules, which attract and repel
each other according to sympathies and antipathies.
Each kind of mineral has the power of
converting immense masses into its own nature,
as we convert our food into flesh and blood. The
mountains are the respiratory organs of the globe,
and the schists its organs of secretion; it is by
these latter that it decomposes the water of the
sea, in order to produce the matters ejected by volcanoes.
The veins are carious sores, abscesses of
the mineral kingdom; and the metals are products
of rottenness and disease, which is the
reason that almost all of them have so bad a
smell<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>More recently still, a philosophy, which substitutes
metaphor for reasoning, and proceeds on
the system of absolute identity or of pantheism, attributes
the production of all phenomena, or which,
in the eyes of its supporters, is the same thing,
all beings, to polarization, such as is manifested
by the two electricities; and denominating every
kind of opposition or difference, whether of situation,
of nature, or of function, by the title of Polarisation,
opposes to each other, in the first place,
God and the universe; then, in the universe, the
sun and the planets; next, in each planet, the
solid and the liquid; and, pursuing this course,
changing its figures and allegories according to
its necessities, at length arrives at the last details
of organic species<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<p>It must, however, be observed, that these are
what may be termed extreme examples, and that
all geologists have not carried the extravagance
of their conceptions to such a length as those
which we have just cited. Yet, among those who
have proceeded with more caution, and have not
searched for geological causes beyond the limits
of physical and chemical science, much diversity
and contradiction still prevail.</p>

</div>

<p>According to one system, every thing has been
successively precipitated by crystallization, and
deposited nearly as it exists at present; but the
sea, which covered all, has gradually retired<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p>According to another, the materials of which
the mountains consist, are incessantly worn down
and carried off by the rivers to be deposited at
the bottom of the sea, where they are heated under
an enormous pressure, and form strata, which
are one day to be violently lifted up by the heat
which consolidates them<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.</p>

<p>A third supposes the fluid divided into a multitude
of lakes, placed, like the seats of an amphitheatre,
above each other, which, after having
deposited our shelly strata, have successively broken
their dikes, to descend and fill the basin of
the ocean<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.</p>

<p>According to a fourth, tides of seven or eight
hundred fathoms depth have carried off, from time
to time, the matter lying at the bottom of the sea,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
and have thrown it, in the form of mountains and
hills, upon the original valleys or plains of the
continent<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.</p>

<p>A fifth makes the various fragments of which
the earth is composed, fall successively from heaven,
in the manner of meteoric stones, bearing the
impress of their foreign origin in the unknown
beings whose remains they contain<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<p>A sixth represents the globe as hollow, and
places within it a loadstone nucleus, which is
transported from one pole to the other, by the attraction
of comets, carrying along with it the centre
of gravity, and the mass of waters at the surface;
thus alternately drowning the two hemispheres<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

<p>We might mention twenty other systems, as
different from one another as those enumerated.
And to prevent mistake, we may here state, that
our intention is not captiously to criticize or find
fault with their authors; on the contrary, we admit
that these ideas have generally been conceived
by men of intellect and knowledge, who were not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
ignorant of facts, several of whom had even travelled
extensively for the purpose of examining
them, and who, in this manner, made numerous
and important additions to science.</p>

</div>

<p>Whence comes it, then, that there should be
so much contrariety in the solutions of the same
problem, that are given by men who proceed upon
the same principles? May not this have been
occasioned by the conditions of the problem never
having been all taken into consideration at
once; by which it has remained hitherto indeterminate,
and susceptible of many solutions,&mdash;all
equally good, when such or such conditions are
abstracted; and all equally bad, when a new condition
comes to be known, or when the attention
is directed to some condition which had been formerly
neglected?</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Nature_and_Conditions"><em>Nature and Conditions of the Problem.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>To quit the language of mathematics, it may
be asserted, that almost all the authors of these systems,
confining their attention to certain difficulties
which struck them more forcibly than others,
have endeavoured to solve these in a manner more
or less plausible, and have left unnoticed others,
equally numerous, and equally important. For
example, the only difficulty with one consisted in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
explaining the changes that had taken place in
the level of the sea; with another, it consisted in
accounting for the solution of all terrestrial substances
in one and the same menstruum; and with
a third, in shewing how animals that were believed
to be natives of the torrid zone could live
in the frigid zone. Exhausting all the powers
of the mind upon these questions, they conceived
that they had done every thing that was necessary
when they had contrived some method of
answering them; and yet, while they neglected
all the other phenomena, they did not always
think of determining with precision the measure
and limits of those which they had endeavoured
to explain.</p>

<p>This is peculiarly the case with regard to the
secondary formations, which constitute, however,
the most important and most difficult part of
the problem. During a long time, all that was
done with respect to these, consisted of feeble attempts
to determine the order of superposition of
their strata, and the connections of these strata
with the species of animals and plants whose remains
they contain.</p>

<p>Are there certain animals and plants peculiar
to certain strata, and not found in others? What
are the species that appear first in order, and what
those which succeed? Do these two kinds of
species sometimes accompany each other? Are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
there alternations in their appearance; or, in other
words, do the first reappear a second time, and
do the others then disappear? Have these animals
and plants all lived in the places where their
remains are found, or have they been transported
thither from other places? Do they all live at
the present day in some part of the earth, or have
they been partially or totally destroyed? Is there
any constant connection between the antiquity of
the strata and the resemblance, or non-resemblance,
of the fossils contained in them to the
animals and plants which now exist? Is there
any connexion, in regard to climate, between
the fossils and such living beings as resemble
them most? May it be concluded, that the
transportation of these living beings, if such a
thing ever happened, has taken place from north
to south, or from east to west; or were they irregularly
scattered and mingled together; and can
the epochs of these transportations be determined
by the characters which they have impressed upon
the strata?</p>

<p>What can be said regarding the causes of the
existing state of the globe, if no reply can be
made to these questions,&mdash;if there be no sufficient
grounds to determine the choice between answering
in the affirmative or negative? It is
but too true, that, for a long time, none of these
points was satisfactorily determined; and scarcely
even would geologists seem to have had any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
idea of the propriety of clearing them up before
constructing their systems.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Reason_for_which"><em>Reason for which the Conditions of the Problem have
been neglected.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>The reason of this strange procedure will be
discovered, when we reflect, that all geologists
have hitherto been, either mere cabinet naturalists,
who had themselves paid little attention
to the structure of mountains, or mere mineralogists,
who had not studied in sufficient detail the
innumerable varieties of animals, and the infinite
complication of their various parts. The former
of these have only constructed systems: the latter
have furnished excellent observations, and have
laid the foundation of true geological science; but
have been unable to complete the edifice.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Progress_of_Mineral_Geology"><em>Progress of Mineral Geology.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>The purely mineral part of the great problem
of the Theory of the Earth has been investigated
with admirable care by Saussure, and has been
since carried to an astonishing degree of development
by Werner, and by the numerous enlightened
pupils of his school.</p>

<p>The former of these celebrated men, by a laborious
investigation of the most inaccessible districts,
continued for twenty years, in which he
examined the Alps on all sides, and penetrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
through all their defiles; has laid open to our
view the entire disorder of the primitive formations,
and has distinctly traced the limits by which
they are distinguished from the secondary formations.
The other, taking advantage of the numerous
excavations made in the most ancient mining
district in the world, has fixed the laws by
which the succession of the strata are regulated,
pointing out the relative antiquity of these strata,
and tracing each of them through all its metamorphoses.
It is from him, and from him alone,
that we date the commencement of real geology,
in so far as concerns the mineral nature of
the strata: but neither he nor Saussure have determined
the fossil organic species occurring in
each kind of stratum, with the accuracy which
has become necessary, now that the number of
animals already known is so great.</p>

<p>Other naturalists, it is true, have examined the
the fossil remains of organised bodies; they have
collected and figured them by thousands, and
their works will serve as so many precious collections
of materials. But, considering these animals
and plants more with reference to their own
nature, than as connected with the theory of the
earth; or regarding these petrifactions as curiosities,
rather than as historical documents; or,
lastly, contenting themselves with practical explanations
regarding the position of each frag<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>ment,
they have almost always neglected to investigate
the general laws affecting the geological
position of organic remains, or their connection
with the strata.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Importance_of_Fossil_Remains"><em>Importance of Fossil Remains in Geology.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>And yet, the idea of such an investigation was
very natural; for it is abundantly obvious, that it
is to these fossil remains alone that we owe even the
commencement of a theory of the earth, and that,
without them, we should perhaps never have even
suspected that there had existed any successive
epochs, and a series of different operations, in the
formation of the globe. By them alone we are, in
fact, enabled to ascertain, that the globe has not always
had the same external crust; because, we
are thoroughly assured, that the plants and
animals must have lived at the surface before
they had thus come to be buried deep beneath it.
It is only by analogy that we have been enabled
to extend to the primitive formations, the conclusion
which is furnished directly for the secondary
by the organic remains which they contain;
and if there had only existed formations in which
no fossil remains were inclosed, it could never
have been shewn that these formations had not
all been of simultaneous origin.</p>

<p>It is also by means of the organic remains,
slight as is the knowledge we have hitherto ac<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>quired
of them, that we have been enabled to discover
the little that we yet know respecting the
nature of the revolutions of the globe. From
them we have learned, that the strata in which
they are buried have been quietly deposited in a
fluid; that their variations have corresponded
with those of the fluid in question; that their being
laid bare has been occasioned by the transportation
of this fluid to some other place; and that
this circumstance must have befallen them more
than once. Nothing of all this could have been
known with certainty, had no fossil remains existed.</p>

<p>The study of the mineral part of geology,
though not less necessary, and even of much more
utility to the practical arts, is yet much less instructive
with reference to the object of our present
inquiry.</p>

<p>We remain in utter ignorance respecting the
causes which have given rise to the variety in the
mineral substances of which the strata are composed.
We are even ignorant of the agents
which may have held some of these substances in
solution; and it is still disputed, respecting several
of them, whether they have owed their origin
to water or to fire. After all, philosophers are only
agreed on one point, which is, that the sea has
changed its place; and how should this have been
known, unless by means of the fossil remains?</p>

<p>The organic remains, therefore, which have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
given rise to the theory of the earth, have, at the
same time, furnished it with its principal illustrations;&mdash;the
only ones, indeed, that have as yet
been generally acknowledged.</p>

<p>It is this consideration which has encouraged
us to investigate the subject. But the field is
vast; and it is but a very small portion of it that
could be cultivated by the labour of a single individual.
It was necessary, therefore, to select a
particular department; and the choice was soon
made. The class of fossil remains which forms
the subject of this work, engaged our attention
at the very outset, because it appeared to us to
be that which is the most fertile in precise results,
and yet, at the same time, less known, and richer
in new objects of research<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="High_importance"><em>High importance of the Fossil Bones of Quadrupeds.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>It is obvious, in fact, that the fossil bones of
quadrupeds must lead to more accurate conclusions
than any other remains of organized bodies,
and that for several reasons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>In the first place, they indicate much more
clearly the nature of the revolutions to which
they have already been subjected. Shells certainly
announce the fact, that the sea has once existed
in the places where they have been formed;
but the changes which have taken place in their
species, when rigorously inquired into, may have
arisen from slight changes in the nature of the
fluid in which they lived, or merely in its temperature.
They may even have been produced by
causes still more accidental. We can never be
perfectly assured that certain species, and even
genera, inhabiting the bottom of the sea, and occupying
certain fixed spaces, for a longer or shorter
time, may not have been driven away and
supplanted by other species or genera.</p>

<p>In regard to quadrupeds, on the contrary, every
thing is precise. The appearance of their bones
in strata, and still more of their entire carcases,
announces, either that the stratum itself
which contains them has, at a former period, been
laid dry, or, at least, that dry land must have existed
in its neighbourhood. Their disappearance renders
it certain, that this stratum has been inundated,
or that the dry land in question has ceased
to exist. It is from them, therefore, that we learn
with perfect certainty the important fact of repeated
irruptions of the sea, which the shells
and other marine productions could not of them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>selves
have proved; and it is by a careful investigation
of them, that we may hope to ascertain the
number and the epochs of these irruptions.</p>

<p>Secondly, The nature of the revolutions which
have altered the surface of the globe, must have
exerted a more powerful action upon terrestrial
quadrupeds, than upon marine animals. As these
revolutions have consisted chiefly of changes in
the bed of the sea, and as the waters must have
destroyed all the quadrupeds which they reached,
if their irruption was general, it would necessarily
have destroyed the entire class; or if it only
overwhelmed certain continents at one time, it
would at least have destroyed the species peculiar
to those continents, without having the same
effect upon the marine animals. On the other
hand, millions of aquatic animals would have been
left dry, or buried under newly-formed strata, or
thrown violently on the coasts; while their races
would still have been preserved in some more
peaceful parts of the sea, whence they might again
be propagated after the agitation of the waters
had ceased.</p>

<p>Thirdly, This more complete action is also
more easily ascertained. It is more easy to demonstrate
its effects, because, the number of quadrupeds
being limited, and the greater part of
their species, at least the large ones, being known,
we have more means of determining whether fos<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>sil
bones belong to them, or to a species that is
now lost. As, on the other hand, we are very
far from being acquainted with all the testaceous
animals and fishes which inhabit the sea,
and as we are still probably ignorant of the
greater number of those which live in deep water,
it is impossible to know with certainty, whether
a species which occurs in a fossil state, may not
still exist somewhere alive. And hence, we see
naturalists persisting in giving the name of pelagic
shells, that is to say, shells inhabiting the
open sea, to the belemnites, cornua-ammonis, and
other testaceous remains, which have hitherto
been found only in the older strata; meaning
by this, that if they have not yet been discovered
in a living state, it is because they inhabit the
depths of the sea, far beyond the reach of our
nets.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Small_probability"><em>Small probability of discovering New Species of
large Quadrupeds.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>Naturalists, certainly, have not yet explored all
the continents, nor do they even know all the
quadrupeds which inhabit the countries that they
have explored. New species of this class are discovered
from time to time; and those who have
not examined with attention all the circumstances
belonging to these discoveries, might also
imagine that the unknown quadrupeds, whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
bones are found in our strata, may remain to this
day concealed, in some islands not yet discovered
by navigators, or in some of the vast deserts
which occupy the middle of Asia, Africa, the two
Americas, and New Holland.</p>

<p>However, if we carefully examine what kinds
of quadrupeds have been recently discovered, and
in what circumstances they have been found, we
shall see that there is little hope of our ever finding
alive those which have hitherto been observed
only in a fossil state.</p>

<p>Islands of moderate extent, and at a considerable
distance from the continents or large islands,
possess very few quadrupeds, and these, for the
greater part, of diminutive size. When they happen
to contain any of the larger species, these must
have been carried to them from other countries.
Bougainville and Cook found no other large quadrupeds
than hogs and dogs in the South Sea
Islands; and the largest species of the West India
Islands was the <em>agouti</em>.</p>

<p>It is true that the great continents, such as
Asia, Africa, the two Americas, and New Holland,
possess large quadrupeds, and, generally
speaking, contain species peculiar to each; insomuch,
that whenever large countries of this description
have been discovered, which their situation
has kept isolated from the rest of the world,
the class of quadrupeds which they contained has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
been found entirely different from any that existed
elsewhere. Thus, when the Spaniards first
penetrated into South America, they did not find
a single species of quadruped the same as any of
Europe, Asia, or Africa. The puma, the jaguar,
the tapir, the cabiai, the <ins class="corr" id="tn-58" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'lama, the vicuna'">
llama, the vicuna</ins>, the
sloths, the armadilloes, the opossums, and the whole
tribe of sapajous, were to them entirely new animals,
of which they had no idea. Similar circumstances
have recurred in our own time, when
the coasts of New Holland and the adjacent
islands were first explored. The various species
of kangaroo, phascolomys, dasyurus, and perameles,
the flying phalangers, the ornithorynchi and
echidnæ, have astonished naturalists by the strangeness
of their conformations, which presented proportions
contrary to all former rules, and were
incapable of being arranged under any of the systems
then in use.</p>

<p>If there yet remained some great continent to
be discovered, we might still hope to become acquainted
with new species, among which there
might be found some having more or less similarity
to those of which we have discovered the
remains in the bowels of the earth. But it is
sufficient to cast a glance over the map of the
world, and see the innumerable directions in
which navigators have traversed the ocean, in order
to be satisfied that there remains no other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
large land to be discovered, unless it may be situated
towards the South Pole, where the existence
of life would necessarily be precluded by the
accumulation of ice.</p>

<p>Hence, it is only from the interior of the large
divisions of the world, that we can have any hope
of still procuring quadrupeds hitherto unknown.
But a little reflection will be sufficient to convince
us, that our expectations from this source
have as little foundation as from that of the islands.</p>

<p>Doubtless, the European traveller cannot easily
traverse vast extents of countries, which are
either destitute of inhabitants, or are peopled only
with ferocious tribes; and this is more especially
true with regard to Africa. But there is nothing
to prevent the animals themselves from roaming
over these countries in all directions, and penetrating
to the coasts. Even when there may be
great chains of mountains between the coasts and
the deserts of the interior, they must always be
broken in some places to allow the rivers to pass
through; and, in these burning deserts, the quadrupeds
naturally follow the banks of rivers.
The inhabitants of the coasts also ascend these
rivers, and soon become acquainted with all the
remarkable species which exist even to their
sources, either from personal observation, or by
means of intercourse with the inhabitants of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
the interior. At no period, therefore, could
civilized nations have frequented the coast of a
large country for any considerable length of time,
without gaining some tolerable knowledge of such
of the animals which it contained as were remarkable
for their size or configuration.</p>

<p>This reasoning is confirmed by well known
facts. Although the ancients never passed the
mountains of Imaus, or crossed the Ganges, in
Asia; and, although they never penetrated very
far beyond Mount Atlas, in Africa; yet were
they, in reality, acquainted with all the large animals
of these two divisions of the world; and,
if they have not distinguished all the species, it
was not because they had not seen them, or heard
them spoken of by others, but because the mutual
resemblances of some of these species caused
them to be confounded together. The only important
exception which can be opposed to this assertion,
presents itself in the Tapir of Malacca,
recently sent home from India by two young naturalists,
pupils of mine, Messrs Duvaucel and
Diard, and which in fact is one of the most interesting
discoveries with which Natural History
has been enriched in these latter times.</p>

<p>The ancients were perfectly acquainted with
the Elephant; and the history of that quadruped
is given more accurately by Aristotle than by
Buffon. They were not even ignorant of some of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
the differences which distinguish the elephants of
Africa from those of Asia<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.</p>

<p>They knew the two-horned Rhinoceros, which
has never been seen alive in modern Europe.
Domitian exhibited it at Rome, and had it
stamped on his medals, which have been very
well described by Pausanias.</p>

<p>The one-horned Rhinoceros, distant as was its
country, was equally known to them. Pompey
shewed one at Rome; and Strabo has accurately
described another which he saw at Alexandria<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.</p>

<p>The Rhinoceros of Sumatra described by Mr
Bell; and that of Java, discovered and sent home
by Messrs Duvaucel and Diard, do not appear to
inhabit the continent. Hence, it is not surprising,
that the ancients should have been ignorant
of them; besides, they probably would not have
distinguished them from the others.</p>

<p>The Hippopotamus has not been so well described
as the preceding animals; yet very exact
representations of it have been left by the Romans
in their monuments relative to Egypt, such
as the statue of the Nile, the Palestrine pave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>ment,
and a great number of medals. In fact,
this animal was repeatedly seen by the Romans;
having been exhibited by Scaurus, Augustus,
Antoninus, Commodus, Heliogabalus, Philip,
and Carinus<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.</p>

<p>The two species of Camel, the Bactrian and
Arabian, are both very well described and characterized
by Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.</p>

<p>The Giraffe, or Camelopard (Camel-Leopard),
was also well known to the ancients. A live one
was shewn at Rome, in the circus, during the
dictatorship of Julius Cæsar, in the year of Rome
708; and ten of them were exhibited together by
Gordian III. all of which were killed at the secular
games of Philip<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>, a circumstance which
may well surprise the moderns, who have only
witnessed a single individual, which was sent by
the Soldan of Egypt to Laurentius de Medicis,
in the fifteenth century, and is painted in the
frescoes of Poggio-Cajano.</p>

<p>If we read with attention the descriptions of
the Hippopotamus, given by Herodotus and Aristotle,
and which are supposed to have been
borrowed from Hecatæus of Miletum, we shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
find, that they must have been made up from two
different animals, one of which was perhaps the
true hippopotamus, and the other was assuredly
the Gnou<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>, a quadruped, of which our naturalists
begin to take notice only about the end of
the eighteenth century. It is the same animal
of which fabulous accounts were given by Pliny
and Ælian, under the name of <em>catoblepas</em> and
<em>catablepon</em><a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.</p>

<p>The Ethiopian Boar of Agatharchides, which
is described as having horns, is precisely the
Ethiopian Boar of modern times, the enormous
tusks of which deserve the name of horns nearly
as much as those of the elephant<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.</p>

<p>The Bubalus and Nagor are described by
Pliny<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>; the Gazelle by Ælian<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>; the Oryx by
Oppian<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>; the Axis, so early as the time of Ctesias<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>;
and the Algazel, and Corinne, are accurately
figured upon the Egyptian monuments<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>Ælian has well described the <em>Bos grunniens</em>
or Yak, under the name of the ox having a tail
which serves for a fly-flapper<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<p>The Buffalo was not domesticated by the ancients;
but the Indian Ox, of which Ælian
speaks<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, and which had horns large enough to
hold three amphoræ, was assuredly that variety
of the buffalo which is now called the <em>arnee</em>.
And even the wild ox with depressed horns,
which is mentioned by Aristotle as inhabiting
Arachosia, a province of ancient Persia, could be
nothing else than the common buffalo<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<p>The ancients were acquainted with the hornless
variety of the ox<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>, and with the African
oxen, whose horns, being only attached to the
skin, moved with it<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. They also knew the Indian
oxen, which equalled the horse in speed<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>;
and those which were so small as not to exceed a
he-goat in size<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>. Nor were the broad-tailed
sheep unknown to them<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>,&mdash;nor those of India,
which were said to be as large as asses<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>.</p>

<p>Although the accounts left us by the ancients,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
respecting the Aurochs, the Rein-deer, and Elk,
are all mingled with fable, they are yet sufficient
to prove that these animals were in some degree
known to them, but that the reports which had
reached them, had been communicated by ignorant
people, and had not been corrected by a judicious
examination<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. These animals still inhabit
the countries which the ancients assigned to
them; and have only disappeared in such of them
as have been too much cultivated for their habits.
The aurochs<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and elk still exist in the forests
of Lithuania, which were formerly continuous
with the great Hercynian Forest. The former
of these animals still occurs in the northern
parts of Greece, as it did in the days of Pausanias.
The rein-deer inhabits the snowy regions
of the north, where it always had its abode; it
changes its colour, not at pleasure, but according
to the change of the seasons. It was in consequence
of mistakes scarcely excusable, that it was
imagined to have occurred in the Pyrenees in the
fourteenth century<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>Even the White Bear had been seen in Egypt
while under the Ptolemies<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.</p>

<p>Lions and Panthers were common at Rome,
where they were presented by hundreds in the
games of the Circus. Even several Tigers were
exhibited there, as well as the Striped Hyena
and the Crocodile of the Nile. In the ancient
mosaics preserved at Rome, there are excellent
representations of the rarest of these animals.
Among others, the striped hyena is seen represented
with accuracy in a fragment preserved in
the Museum of the Vatican; and, while I was at
Rome in 1809, a mosaic pavement, composed of
natural stones, arranged in the Florentine manner,
was discovered in a garden beside the triumphal
arch of Galienus, which represented four
Bengal tigers executed in a superior manner.</p>

<p>In the Museum of the Vatican, there is deposited
the figure of a crocodile in basalt, which is
almost a perfect representation of that animal<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>It cannot in the least be doubted, that the
<em>Hippotigris</em> was the Zebra, which, however, is
only found in the southern parts of Africa<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.</p>

<p>It would be easy to shew that almost all the
more remarkable species of Apes and Monkeys
have been distinctly indicated by the ancients,
under the names of <em>Pitheci</em>, <em>Sphinxes</em>, <em>Satyri</em>,
<em>Cebi</em>, <em>Cynocephali</em>, and <em>Cercopitheci</em><a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<p>They even knew, and have described several
species of Glires of inconsiderable size, when these
animals presented any thing remarkable in their
conformation or properties<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. But the small
species are of no importance with reference to
the object in view; and, it is sufficient for our
purpose to have shewn, that all the large species,
which possess any remarkable character, and which
we know to inhabit Europe, Asia, and Africa, at
the present day, were known to the ancients;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
whence we may fairly conclude, that their silence
in respect to the small quadrupeds, and their neglect
in distinguishing the species which very
nearly resemble each other, as the various species
of antelopes, and of some other genera, were occasioned
by want of attention and ignorance of methodical
arrangement, rather than by any difficulty
proceeding from climate. We may also
conclude, with equal certainty, that, as the lapse
of eighteen or twenty centuries, together with the
advantages of circumnavigating Africa, and of penetrating
into India, have added nothing in this
department to the information left us by the ancients,
there is no probability that succeeding
ages will add much to the knowledge of our posterity.</p>

<p>But perhaps some persons may be disposed to
employ an opposite train of argument, and to allege
that the ancients were not only acquainted
with as many <ins class="corr" id="tn-68" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'large qradupeds'">
large quadrupeds</ins> as we are, as has
already been shewn, but that they have described
several others which we do not now know,&mdash;that
we act rashly in considering these animals as fabulous,&mdash;that
we ought to search for them before
concluding that we have exhausted the history
of the present animal creation,&mdash;and, in fine, that
among those animals which we presume to be fabulous,
we may, perhaps, discover, when we become
better acquainted with them, the originals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
of those bones of unknown animals which we discover
buried in the earth. Some may even conceive,
that those various monsters, which constitute
the essential ornaments of the history of the
heroic ages of almost all countries, are precisely
those very species which it was necessary to destroy,
in order to allow the establishment of civilization.
Thus the Theseuses and Bellerophons
of ancient times had been more fortunate than all
the nations of our days, which have only been
able to drive back the noxious animals, but have
never yet succeeded in exterminating a single
species.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Inquiry_respecting"><em>Inquiry respecting the Fabulous Animals of the Ancients.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>It is easy to reply to the foregoing objection, by
examining the descriptions of these unknown beings,
and by inquiring into their origins. The
greater number of them have an origin purely mythological,
and of this origin their descriptions
bear unequivocal marks; for in almost all of them
we see merely parts of known animals united by
an unbridled imagination, and in contradiction to
all the laws of nature.</p>

<p>Those which were invented or arranged by the
Greeks, have at least the merit of possessing elegance
in their composition. Like those ara<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>besques
which decorate the remains of some ancient
buildings, and which have been multiplied by the
fertile pencil of Raphael, the forms which they
combine, however repugnant to reason they may
be, present agreeable contours. They are the
fantastic productions of playful genius; perhaps
emblematic representations in the oriental taste,
in which were supposed to be concealed under mystical
images certain propositions in metaphysics
or in morals. We may excuse those who employ
their time in attempts to discover the wisdom concealed
in the sphinx of Thebes, the pegasus of
Thessaly, the minotaur of Crete, or the chimera
of Epirus; but it would be absurd to expect seriously
to find such productions in nature. As well
might we search for the animals described in the
Book of Daniel, or for the beast of the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>Neither may we look for the mythological animals
of the Persians, creatures of a still bolder
imagination: the <em>martichore</em>, or man-destroyer,
bearing a human head on the body of a lion, terminated
by the tail of a scorpion<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>; the <em>griffon</em>,
guardian of treasures, half eagle, half lion<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
<em>cartazonon</em>, or wild ass, armed with a long horn
on its forehead<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.</p>

<p>Ctesias, who has described these as real animals,
has been looked upon by many authors as an inventor
of fables; whereas he has merely attributed
an actual existence to emblematical figures.
These imaginary compositions have been seen in
modern times sculptured upon the ruins of Persepolis<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>.
What they were intended to signify
we shall probably never know; but of this much
we are certain, that they do not represent actual
beings.</p>

<p>Agatharchidas, another fabricator of animals,
drew his information in all probability from a similar
source. The ancient Egyptian monuments
still furnish us with numerous fantastic representations,
in which the parts of different species are
combined: gods are often figured with a human
body and the head of an animal, and animals are
seen with human heads; thus giving rise to the
cynocephali, sphinxes, and satyrs of ancient naturalists.
The custom of representing in the same
painting men of very different sizes, of making the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
king or the conqueror gigantic, the subjects or the
conquered three or four times smaller, must have
given rise to the fable of the pigmies. It was in
some corner of one of these monuments that Agatharchidas
must have seen his carnivorous bull,
which, with mouth extending from ear to ear, devoured
every other animal<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. Certainly no naturalist
would admit the existence of such an animal;
for nature never combines either cloven hoofs or
horns with teeth adapted for devouring animal
food.</p>

<p>There may perhaps have been many other figures
equally strange, either among such of these
monuments as have not been able to resist the ravages
of time, or in the temples of Ethiopia and
Arabia, which have been destroyed by the religious
zeal of the Mahometans and Abyssinians.
The monuments of India teem with such figures;
but the combinations in these are too extravagant
to have deceived any one. Monsters with a hundred
arms, and twenty heads all different from
one another, are far too absurd to be believed.
Nay, the inhabitants of Japan and China also
have their imaginary animals, which they represent
as real, and which figure even in their religious
books. The Mexicans had them. In short,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
they are the fashion among all nations, whether
at the periods when their idolatry has not yet been
refined, or when the import of these emblematical
combinations has been lost. But who would dare
to affirm that he had found those productions of
ignorance and superstition in nature? And yet it
may have happened that travellers, influenced by
a desire of making themselves famous, might pretend
that they had seen those strange beings, or
that, deceived by a slight resemblance, into which
they were too careless to enquire, they may have
taken real animals for them. In the eyes of such
people, large baboons or monkeys may have appeared
true cynocephali, sphinxes, or men with
tails. It is thus that St Augustin may have imagined
he had seen a satyr.</p>

<p>Some real animals, inaccurately observed and
described, may have given rise to monstrous ideas,
which, however, have had their foundation in some
reality. Thus, we can have no doubt of the existence
of the hyena, although that animal has not
its neck supported by a single bone<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>, and although
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
it does not change its sex every year, as
Pliny alleges<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. Thus, also, the carnivorous bull is
perhaps nothing else than a two-horned rhinoceros
erroneously described. M. de Weltheim affirms
with probability, that the auriferous ants of Herodotus
are <em>corsacs</em>.</p>

<p>One of the most famous amongst these fabulous
animals of the ancients, is the <em>unicorn</em>. Even to
our own time people have obstinately persisted in
searching for it, or, at least, in seeking arguments
to prove its existence. <ins class="corr" id="tn-74" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Three several'">
Three separate</ins> animals are
frequently mentioned by the ancients as having
only one horn in the middle of the forehead. The
<em>African oryx</em>, having cloven hoofs, the hair
placed in the contrary direction to that of other
animals<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>, equal in size to the bull<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> or even the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
rhinoceros<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>, and said to resemble deer and goats
in form<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>; the <em>Indian ass</em>, having solid hoofs;
and the <em>monoceros</em>, properly so called, whose feet
are sometimes compared to those of the lion<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>, and
sometimes to those of the elephant<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>, and which
is therefore considered as having divided feet.
The one-horned horse<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and one-horned bull are
doubtless both to be referred to the Indian ass, for
even the latter is described as having solid hoofs<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.
I would ask, If these animals exist as distinct species,
should we not at least have their horns in
our collections? And what single horns do we
possess, excepting those of the rhinoceros and narwal?</p>

<p>How is it possible, after this, to refer to rude
figures traced by savages upon rocks<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>? Ignorant
of perspective, and wishing to represent a straight
horned antelope in profile, they could only give it
a single horn, and thus they produced an oryx.
The oryxes, too, that are seen on the Egyptian
monuments, are probably nothing more than productions
of the stiff style, imposed upon the artists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
of that country by their religion. Many of
their profiles of quadrupeds shew only one fore
and one hind leg; and this being the case, why
should they have shewn two horns? It may perhaps
have chanced that individuals have been taken
in the chace, which had accidentally lost one
of their horns, as pretty frequently happens to the
chamois and saiga: and this would have been
sufficient to confirm the error produced by these
representations. It is probably in this way that
the unicorn has recently been reported to be found
in the mountains of Thibet.</p>

<p>All the ancients, however, have not represented
the oryx as having only one horn. Oppian expressly
gives it several<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>, and Ælian mentions
oryxes which had four<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. Finally, if this animal
was ruminant and cloven-hoofed, we know assuredly
that its frontal bone must have been longitudinally
divided into two, and that it could not,
as is very justly remarked by Camper, have had a
horn placed upon the suture.</p>

<p>But it may be asked, What two-horned animal
could have given the idea of the oryx, and presented
the characters which it is described as possessing
with regard to its conformation, even independent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
of the notion of a single horn? To this
I reply, with Pallas, that it was the straight
horned antelope, the <em>Antilope oryx</em> of Gmelin,
improperly named <em>pasan</em> by Buffon. It inhabits
the deserts of Africa, and must approach the confines
of Egypt. It is this animal which the hieroglyphics
appear to represent. Its form is nearly
that of the stag; its size equals that of the
bull; the hair of its back is directed toward the
head; its horns form exceedingly formidable weapons,
pointed like javelins, and hard as iron; its
hair is whitish, and its face is marked with spots
and streaks of black. Such is the description given
of it by naturalists; and the fables of the
Egyptian priests, which have occasioned the insertion
of its figure among their hieroglyphics, do
not require to have been founded in nature. Supposing,
therefore, that an individual of this species
had been seen which had lost one of its horns
by some accident, it might have been taken as a
representative of the whole race, and erroneously
adopted by Aristotle, and copied by his successors.
All this is possible, and even natural, and yet
proves nothing with regard to the existence of a
single-horned species.</p>

<p>In regard to the Indian ass, if we attend to the
properties ascribed to its horns as an antidote against
poison, we shall see that they are precisely
the same as those which the eastern nations attri<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>bute
at the present day to the horn of the rhinoceros.
When this horn was first imported into
Greece, the animal to which it belonged might
still have been unknown. In fact, Aristotle
makes no mention of the rhinoceros, and Agatharchides
was the first who described it. In the
same manner, ivory was in use among the ancients
long before they were acquainted with the
elephant. It is even possible that some of their
travellers might have given to the rhinoceros the
name of <em>Indian ass</em>, with as much propriety as
the Romans denominated the elephant the <em>bull
of Lucania.</em> Every thing, moreover, that is said
of the strength, size, and ferocity of this wild ass
of theirs, corresponds very well with the rhinoceros.
In succeeding times, naturalists, who had
now become better acquainted with the rhinoceros,
finding this denomination of <em>Indian ass</em> in
the writings of authors who had preceded them,
might have taken it, from want of proper examination,
for that of a distinct animal; and from
the name, they would have concluded the animal
should have solid hoofs. There is, indeed, a full
description of the Indian ass given by Ctesias<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>, but
we have seen above that it had been taken from
the bas-reliefs of Persepolis, and must therefore go
for nothing in the real history of the animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>When there afterwards appeared more exact
descriptions of an animal having a single horn
only, but with several toes, a third species would
have been made out, to which they gave the name
of <em>monoceros</em>. These double references applied
to the same species, are more frequent among
ancient naturalists, because most of their works
which have come down to us were mere compilations;
even because Aristotle himself has frequently
mingled facts borrowed from others with
those which he had observed himself; and because
the habit of critical examination was then as little
known among naturalists as among historians.</p>

<p>From all these reasonings and digressions, it
may be fairly concluded, that the large animals of
the old continent with which we are now acquainted,
were known to the ancients; and that the animals
described by the ancients, and which are
now unknown, were fabulous. It also follows,
that the large animals of the three principal parts
of the then discovered world could not have been
long in being known to the nations which frequented
their coasts.</p>

<p>It may also be concluded, that no large species
remains to be discovered in America. If there
were any, there can be no reason why we should
not be acquainted with it; and in fact none has
been discovered there during the last hundred
and fifty years. The tapir, the jaguar, the puma,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
the cabiai, the <ins class="corr" id="tn-80" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'lama, the vicunna'">
llama, the vicuna</ins>, the red wolf,
the buffalo or American bison, the ant-eaters,
sloths and armadilloes, are as well described by
Margrave and Hernandez as by Buffon; it may
even be said that they are better, for Buffon has
confused the history of the ant-eaters, mistaken
the jaguar and red wolf, and confounded the bison
of America with the aurochs of Poland. Pennant,
it is true, was the first naturalist who clearly
distinguished the small musk ox; but it was
long before made mention of by travellers. The
cloven-footed horse of Molina, has not been described
by the early Spanish travellers; but its
existence is more than doubtful, and the authority
of Molina is too suspicious to authorise our
adopting it. It might be possible to characterise
more accurately than has been done the different
species of deer belonging to America and India;
but the case is with respect to these animals as it
was among the ancients with respect to the antelopes;
it is the want of a good method for distinguishing
them, and not of opportunities of seeing
them, that has left them so imperfectly known
to us. It may, therefore, be said, that the Mouflon
of the Blue Mountains is the only American
quadruped of any considerable size of which the
discovery is altogether modern; and even it is perhaps
only an argali that may have crossed upon
the ice from Siberia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>How should it be thought, after this, that the
huge <em>mastodons</em> and gigantic <em>megatheria</em>, whose
bones have been discovered under ground in North
and South America, still exist alive on that continent?
How should they have escaped those
wandering tribes which continually traverse the
country in all directions, and which are themselves
aware that these animals no longer exist, since they
have invented a fabulous account of their destruction,
alleging that they were killed by the Great
Spirit, to prevent them from extirpating the human
race. But it is evident that this fable has been
occasioned by the discovery of the bones, like that
of the inhabitants of Siberia with respect to their
mammoth, which they pretend to live under
ground like the mole, and, like all those of the
ancients, about the graves of giants, who were
thought by them to have been buried wherever
the bones of elephants were discovered.</p>

<p>Thus it may safely be concluded, that if, as we
have just said, none of the large species of quadrupeds
whose remains are at the present day
found in regular mineral strata, bear resemblance
to any of the known living species, this is not
the effect of mere chance, nor because those species
of which we possess nothing but the bones,
are still concealed in the deserts, and have hitherto
eluded the observation of travellers. On
the contrary, this phenomenon must be regarded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
as resulting from general causes; and its investigation
may be considered as affording one of the
best means for discovering the nature of these causes.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Difficulty_of_determining"><em>Difficulty of determining the Fossil Bones of
Quadrupeds.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>If this study is more satisfactory in its results
than that of other fossil remains of animals, it is
also beset with more numerous difficulties. Fossil
shells usually present themselves in an entire
state, and with all the characters requisite for
comparing them with their analogous species,
preserved in the collections or figured in the works
of naturalists. Even fishes present their skeleton
more or less entire; the general form of their
body is almost always distinguishable, and most
commonly, also, their generic and specific characters,
which are drawn from their solid parts.
In quadrupeds, on the contrary, even should the
skeleton be found entire, it would be difficult to
apply to it characters derived, for the most part,
from the hair, the colours, and other marks which
have disappeared previous to their incrustation.
It is even excessively rare to find a fossil skeleton
approaching in any considerable degree to a complete
state. The strata, for the most part, only
contain separate bones, scattered confusedly, and almost
always broken, and reduced to fragments; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
these constitute the only resources of knowledge
to the naturalist in this department. It may also
be stated, that most observers, deterred by
these difficulties, have passed slightly over the
fossil bones of quadrupeds; have classed them in
a vague manner, according to superficial resemblances,
or have not even ventured to assign them
a name; so that this part of the history of fossil
remains, although the most important and most
instructive of all, is, at the same time, that which
has been the least cultivated<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Principle_by_which"><em>Principle by which this determination is effected.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>Fortunately, comparative anatomy possesses a
principle, which, when properly developed, enables
us to surmount all the obstacles. This principle
consists in the mutual relation of forms in
organised beings, by means of which, each species
may be determined, with perfect certainty, by
any fragment of any of its parts.</p>

<p>Every organised being forms a whole,&mdash;a peculiar
system of its own, the parts of which mutually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
<ins class="corr" id="tn-84" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'corrrespond, and'">
correspond, and</ins> concur in producing the
same definitive action, by a reciprocal reaction.
None of these parts can change in form, without
the others also changing; and consequently, each
of them, taken separately, indicates and ascertains
all the others.</p>

<p>Thus, if the intestines of an animal are so organised
as to be fitted for the digestion of flesh
only, and that flesh recent, it is necessary that its
jaws be so constructed as to fit them for devouring
live prey; its claws for seizing and tearing it; its
teeth for cutting and dividing it; the whole system
of its organs of motion, for pursuing and
overtaking it; and its organs of sense for discovering
it at a distance. It is even requisite that nature
have placed in its brain the instinct necessary
for teaching it to conceal itself, and to lay
snares for its victims.</p>

<p>Such are the general conditions which nature
imposes upon the structure of carnivorous animals;
and which every animal of this description
must indispensably combine in its constitution,
for without them its race could not subsist. But
subordinate to these general conditions, there exist
others, having relation to the size, the species,
and the haunts of the prey for which the animal
is adapted; and from each of these particular conditions,
there result modifications of detail in the
forms which arise from the general conditions.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
Thus not only the class, but the order, the genus,
and even the species, are found expressed in the
form of each part.</p>

<p>In fact, in order that the jaw may be able to
seize, it must have a certain form of condyle;
that the resistance, the moving power, and the
fulcrum, should have a certain relative position in
regard to each other; and that the temporal
muscles should be of a certain size; the hollow
or depression, too, in which these muscles are
lodged, must have a certain depth; and the zygomatic
arch, under which they pass, must not
only have a certain degree of convexity, but it
must be sufficiently strong to support the action
of the masseter.</p>

<p>In order that the animal may be able to carry
off its prey, it must have a certain degree of vigour
in the muscles which elevate the head; whence
there results a determinate form in the vertebræ
from which these muscles take their rise, and in
the occiput into which they are inserted.</p>

<p>In order that the teeth may be able to cut flesh,
they must be sharp-edged, and must be so in a
greater or less degree, according as they have flesh
more or less exclusively to cut. Their base will
be solid, according to the quantity and size of the
bones which they have to break. The whole of
these circumstances must necessarily influence
the development and form of all the parts which
contribute to move the jaws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>In order that the paws may be able to seize the
prey, there must be a certain degree of mobility
in the toes, and a certain degree of strength in
the claws, from which there will result determinate
forms in all the phalanges, and a corresponding
distribution of muscles and tendons. The
fore-arm, or cubitus, must possess a certain facility
of turning, from which there will also result determinate
forms in the bones of which it is composed.
But the bones of the cubitus being articulated to
the humerus, a change in the proportions of the
former, will necessarily induce a corresponding
change in the latter. The shoulder-bones must
have a certain degree of firmness in such animals
as make use of their fore-legs for seizing, and from
this there must also result a certain peculiarity in
their form. The play of all these parts will require
certain proportions in all their muscles, and
the impressions made by these muscles so proportioned,
will determine still more particularly the
forms of the bones.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that similar conclusions may be
drawn with regard to the posterior extremities
which contribute to the rapidity of the general
motions; with regard to the composition of the
trunk, and the forms of the vertebræ, which exert
an influence upon the facility and flexibility of
these motions; and, lastly, with regard to the forms
of the bones of the nose, of the orbit, and of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
ear, the connection of which with the perfection
of the senses of smell, sight, and hearing, is evident.
In a word, the form of the tooth regulates
the forms of the condyle, of the scapula, and of
the claws, in the same manner as the equation of
a curve regulates all its properties; and as, by taking
each property separately for the base of a
particular equation, we find both the ordinary
equation, and all the other properties whatever;
so, the claw, the scapula, the condyle, the femur,
and all the other bones taken separately, give the
tooth, or are reciprocally given by it; and thus,
by commencing with any one of these bones, a
person who possesses an accurate knowledge of the
laws of organic economy, may reconstruct the
whole animal.</p>

<p>This principle seems sufficiently evident, in
the general acceptation in which it is here taken,
and does not require any fuller demonstration; but
when it comes to be applied, there will be found
many cases where our theoretical knowledge of
the relations of forms will not be sufficient, unless
it be supported by observation and experience.</p>

<p>For example, we are well aware, that hoofed
animals must all be herbivorous, since they have
no means of seizing prey. It is also evident, that,
having no other use to make of their fore-legs than
to support their body, they do not require a shoulder
so vigorously organised as that of carnivo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>rous
animals; they have, therefore, no acromion
or clavicle, and their shoulder-blades are narrow.
Having also no occasion to turn their fore-arm,
their radius is united to the ulna by ossification,
or at least articulated by a ginglimus or hinge-joint,
and not by arthrodia or ball and socket, to
the humerus. Their food being herbaceous, will
require teeth furnished with flat surfaces, for bruising
seeds and plants. The crown of the teeth
must also be unequal, and, for this purpose, must
be composed of parts alternately consisting of bone
and of enamel. Teeth of this structure necessarily
require horizontal motions to enable them
to triturate the food; and hence the condyle of
the jaw cannot be so strictly confined within its
articulating cavity as in the carnivorous animals,
but must be flattened, and thus correspond with
a more or less flattened surface of the temporal
bones. Further, the temporal fossa, which will
only have a small muscle to contain, will be narrower,
and not so shallow, as that of carnivorous
animals. All these circumstances are deducible
from each other, according to their greater or less
generality, and in such a manner, that some of
them are essential and exclusively peculiar to
hoofed animals, while others, although equally
necessary in these animals, are not entirely peculiar
to them, but may occur in other animals also,
where the rest of the conditions will permit their
existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>If we proceed to consider the orders or subdivisions
of the class of hoofed animals, and examine
what modifications the general conditions undergo,
or rather what particular conditions are conjoined
with them, according to the respective characters
of these orders, the reasons of these subordinate
conditions begin to appear less obvious.
We can still easily conceive, in general, the necessity
of a more complicated system of digestive
organs in those species which have a more imperfect
masticatory system; and hence we may
presume, that these latter must be rather ruminating
animals, in which there is wanting such
or such an order of teeth; and may also deduce
from the same consideration, the necessity of a
certain form of the œsophagus, and of corresponding
forms in the vertebræ of the neck, &amp;c. But
I doubt whether it would have been discovered,
independently of actual observation, that the ruminating
animals should all have cloven hoofs,
and that they should be the only animals having
them; that there should be horns on the fore-head
in this class alone; or that such of them as
have sharp canine teeth, should, in general, have
no horns.</p>

<p>However, since these relations are constant, we
may be assured that they have a sufficient cause;
but as we are not acquainted with that cause, we
must supply the defect of theory by means of observation,
and in this way establish empirical laws<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
which become nearly as certain as those deduced
from rational principles, when founded upon observations,
the authenticity of which is proved by
frequent repetition. Hence, at the present day,
any one who observes only the print of a cloven
foot, may conclude that the animal which left this
impression ruminates; and this conclusion is
quite as certain as any other in physics, or in
moral philosophy. This simple footmark, therefore,
indicates at once to the observer the forms of
the teeth, of the jaws, of the vertebræ, of all the
bones of the legs, thighs, shoulders, and pelvis of
the animal which had passed. It is a surer mark
than all those of Zadig. That there are secret
reasons, however, for all these relations, is what
observation alone is sufficient to shew, independently
of any general principles of philosophy.</p>

<p>In fact, when we construct a table of these relations,
we remark not only a specific constancy, if
the expression may be allowed, between a particular
form of a particular organ, and some other
form of a different organ; but we also perceive a
classic constancy of conformation, and a corresponding
gradation, in the development of these
two organs, which demonstrate their mutual influence,
almost as well as the most perfect deduction
of reason.</p>

<p>For example, the dentary system of the hoofed
animals, which are not ruminant, is in general
more perfect than that of the cloven-footed or ru<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>minating
animals, because the former have either
incisors, or canine teeth, and almost always both
in each jaw; and the structure of their foot is in
general more complicated, because they have
more toes or claws, or their phalanges less enveloped
in the hoof,&mdash;or a greater number of distinct
bones in the metacarpus and metatarsus&mdash;or
more numerous tarsal bones&mdash;or a fibula more
distinct from the tibia&mdash;or, lastly, that all these
circumstances are often united in the same species
of animals.</p>

<p>It is impossible to assign reasons for these relations;
but we are certain that they are not the
effects of chance, because, whenever a cloven-footed
animal manifests, in the arrangement of its teeth
some tendency to approach the animals we now
speak of, it also manifests a similar tendency in
the arrangement of its feet. Thus the camels,
which have canine teeth, and even two or four
incisors in the upper jaw, have an additional
bone in the tarsus, because their scaphoid bone is
not united to the cuboid, and they have very
small hoofs, with corresponding phalanges. The
musk animals, whose canine teeth are much developed,
have a distinct fibula along the whole
length of their tibia; while the other cloven-footed
animals have only, in place of a fibula, a small
bone articulated at the lower end of the tibia.
There is, therefore, a constant harmony between
two organs apparently having no connection; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
the gradations of their forms preserve an uninterrupted
correspondence, even in those cases in
which we cannot account for their relations.</p>

<p>Now, by thus adopting the method of observation
as a supplementary means, when theory is no
longer able to direct our views, we arrive at astonishing
results. The smallest articulating surface
of bone, or the smallest apophysis, has a determinate
character, relative to the class, the order, the
genus, and the species to which it belonged; insomuch,
that when one possesses merely a well preserved
extremity of a bone, he can, by careful examination,
and the aid of a tolerable analogical
knowledge, and of accurate comparison, determine
all these things with as much certainty as if he had
the entire animal before him. I have often made
trial of this method upon portions of known animals,
before reposing full confidence upon it,
in regard to fossil remains; and it has always
proved so completely satisfactory, that I have no
longer any doubts regarding the certainty of the
results which it has afforded me.</p>

<p>It is true, that I have enjoyed all the advantages
which were necessary for the undertaking;
and that my favourable situation, in the Museum
of Natural History at Paris, and assiduous research
for nearly thirty years, have procured me
skeletons of all the genera and sub-genera of quadrupeds,
and even of many species in some
genera, and of several varieties of some species.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
With such means, it was easy for me to multiply
my comparisons, and to verify in all their details
the applications which I have made of the various
laws deducible from such circumstances as have
been stated.</p>

<p>We cannot here enter into a more lengthened
detail of this method, and must refer to the
large work on Comparative Anatomy, in which
all its rules will be found. In the mean time, an
intelligent reader may gather a great number of
these from the work upon Fossil Bones, if he take
the trouble of attending to all the applications of
them which we have there made. He will see,
that it is by this method alone that we are guided,
and that it has almost always sufficed for referring
each bone to its species, when it was a living
species&mdash;to its genus, when it was an unknown
species&mdash;to its order, when it was a new genus&mdash;and
to its class, when it belonged to an order
not hitherto established&mdash;and to assign it, in the
three last cases, the proper characters for distinguishing
it from the nearest resembling orders,
genera, and species. Before the commencement
of our researches, naturalists had done no more
than this with regard to animals, which they had
the opportunity of examining in their entire state.
Yet, in this manner, we have determined and
classed the <em>remains</em> of more than a hundred and
fifty mammiferous and oviparous quadrupeds.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="View_of_the_General_Results"><em>View of the General Results of these Researches.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>Considered with regard to species, upwards of
ninety of these animals are most assuredly hitherto
unknown to naturalists; eleven or twelve have
so perfect a resemblance to species already known,
that the slightest doubt cannot be entertained of
their identity; the others exhibit many traits of
resemblance to known species, but their comparison
has not yet been made with sufficient precision
to remove all doubts.</p>

<p>Considered with regard to genera, of the ninety
hitherto unknown species, there are nearly sixty
that belong to new genera. The other species
rank under genera or subgenera already known.</p>

<p>It may not be without use, also, to consider
these animals with regard to the classes and orders
to which they belong. Of the hundred and
fifty species, about a fourth part are oviparous
quadrupeds, and all the rest mammifera. Of these
last, more than the half belong to non-ruminant
hoofed animals.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding what has been done, it would
still be premature to establish upon these numbers
any conclusion relative to the theory of the earth,
because they are not in sufficient proportion to the
numbers of genera and species which may be buried
in the strata of the earth. Hitherto the
bones of the larger species have been chiefly col<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>lected,
these being more obvious to agricultural
labourers; while the bones of the smaller
species are usually neglected, unless when they
chance to fall into the hands of a naturalist, or
when some particular circumstance, such as their
excessive abundance in certain places, attracts the
attention even of the common people.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Relations_of_the_Species"><em>Relations of the Species of Fossil Animals with the
Strata in which they are found.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>The most important consideration, that which,
in fact, is the chief object of all my researches,
and which establishes their legitimate connection
with the Theory of the Earth, is to ascertain in
what strata each species is found, and whether
there may be some general laws, relative either
to the zoological subdivisions, or to the greater
or less resemblance of the species to those of the
present day.</p>

<p>The laws which have been recognised with respect
to these relations are very distinct and satisfactory.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is clearly ascertained that
the oviparous quadrupeds appear much more early
than the viviparous; that they are even more
abundant, larger, and more varied, in the ancient
strata than at the surface of the globe, as it exists
at present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>The Ichthyosauri, the Plesiosauri, several species
of Tortoise, and several species of Crocodile,
are found beneath the chalk, in the deposits commonly
called <em>Jura formations</em>. The Monitors
of Thuringia would be still older, if, according to
the Wernerian School, the copper-slate in which
they are contained, along with a great variety of
fishes supposed to have belonged to fresh-water,
is to be placed among the oldest beds of the secondary
formations. The enormous crocodiles
and the great tortoises of Maestricht, are found
in the chalk formation itself; but these are marine
animals.</p>

<p>This earliest appearance of fossil bones seems,
therefore, already to indicate, that dry lands and
fresh waters had existed before the formation of
the chalk deposits. But neither at this period,
nor while the chalk was forming, nor even long
after, have any bones of land-mammifera been
encrusted; or, at least, the small number of these,
which are alleged to have been found in strata of
these dates, forms but a trifling exception.</p>

<p>We begin to find bones of marine mammifera,
namely, of lamantins and seals, in the coarse
shelly limestone which covers the chalk in the
neighbourhood of Paris; but there are still no
bones of terrestrial mammifera.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the most assiduous investigation,
I have not been able to discover any distinct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
trace of this class in any of the deposits preceding
those which rest upon the coarse limestone. Certain
lignites and molasses do in fact contain
them; but I am very doubtful whether these deposits
are all, as is commonly supposed, anterior
to that limestone. The places where these bones
have been found are so limited, both in extent
and in number, as to induce us to suppose some
irregularity, or some repetition of the formation
containing them. On the contrary, the moment
we arrive at the deposits which rest upon the
coarse limestone, the bones of land-animals present
themselves in great abundance.</p>

<p>As it is reasonable to believe that shells and
fishes did not exist at the period of the formation
of primitive rocks, we are also led to conclude
that the oviparous quadrupeds began to exist
along with the fishes, and at the commencement
of the period during which the secondary
rocks were formed; but that the land-quadrupeds
did not appear upon the earth, at least in any
considerable number, till long after, and until
the coarse limestone strata, which contain the
greater number of our genera of shells, although
of species different from ours, had been deposited.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that those coarse limestone
strata which are used at Paris for building, are
the last formed strata which indicate a long and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
quiet continuance of the sea upon our continents.
Above them, indeed, there are found formations
containing shells and other marine productions;
but these consist of collections of transported matters,
sand, marls, sandstones, and clays, which rather
indicate transportations that have taken
place with more or less violence, than strata formed
by tranquil deposition; and, if there be some
rocky and regular strata of pretty considerable
magnitude, beneath or above these transported
matters, they generally exhibit indications of having
been deposited from fresh water.</p>

<p>Almost all the known bones of viviparous quadrupeds,
therefore, have been found either in those
fresh-water formations, or in the alluvial formations;
and consequently there is every reason to
conclude that these quadrupeds have only begun
to exist, or, at least, to leave their remains in the
strata of our earth, after the last retreat of the
sea but one, and during the state of things that
preceded its last irruption.</p>

<p>But there is also an order in the disposition of
these bones with regard to each other; and this
order further announces a very remarkable succession
in the appearance of the different species.
All the genera which are now unknown, the Palæotheria,
Anaplotheria, &amp;c., with the position of
which we are thoroughly acquainted, belong to
the oldest of the formations of which we are now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
speaking, those which rest immediately upon the
coarse limestone. It is chiefly these genera which
occupy the regular beds that have been deposited
from fresh-water, or certain alluvial beds of very
ancient formation, generally composed of sand and
rolled pebbles, and which were perhaps the earliest
alluvium of that ancient world. Along
with these there are also found some lost species
of known genera, but in small numbers, and some
oviparous quadrupeds and fishes, which appear to
have been all inhabitants of fresh-water. The beds
which contain them are always more or less covered
by alluvial beds, containing shells, and other marine
productions.</p>

<p>The most celebrated of the unknown species,
which belong to known genera, or to genera closely
allied to those which are known, such as the
fossil elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotami, and
mastodons, do not occur along with those more
ancient genera. It is in the alluvial formations
alone that they are discovered, sometimes accompanied
with marine shells, and sometimes with
fresh-water shells, but never in regular stony beds.
Every thing that is found along with these species
is either unknown like themselves, or at least
doubtful.</p>

<p>Lastly, the bones of species which are apparently
the same as those that are still found alive,
are never discovered, except in the last alluvial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
deposits formed on the sides of rivers, or on the
bottoms of ancient pools or marshes now dried up,
or in the substance of beds of peat, or in the fissures
and caverns of some rocks; or, lastly, at
small depths below the surface, in places where
they may have been buried by the falling down
of debris, or even by the hand of man; and their
superficial position renders these bones, although
the most recent of all, almost always the worst
preserved.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be thought that this classification
of the various geological positions of fossil
remains, is as certain as that of the species, or
that it is equally capable of demonstration. There
are numerous reasons which prevent this from being
the case.</p>

<p>In the first place, all my determinations of species
have been made upon the bones themselves,
or by means of good figures; whereas it has been
impossible for me personally to examine all the
places in which these bones have been discovered.
I have very frequently been obliged to content
myself with vague and ambiguous accounts, given
by people who were not themselves well aware of
what it was necessary to observe; and, more frequently
still, I have been unable to procure any
information whatever on the subject.</p>

<p>Secondly, these repositories of organic remains
are subject to infinitely greater doubts, than the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
bones themselves. The same formation may appear
recent in places where it shews itself at the
surface, and ancient in those where it is covered
by the beds which have succeeded it. Ancient
formations may have been transported by partial
inundations, and thus have covered recent bones;
they may have fallen upon them by crumbling,
and thus have enveloped and mingled them with
the productions of the ancient sea, which they
previously contained. Bones of ancient periods
may have been washed out by the waters, and
afterwards enveloped in recent alluvial formations.
Lastly, recent bones may have fallen into the
fissures or caverns of ancient rocks, and been enveloped
by stalactites or other incrustations. In
every individual instance, therefore, it becomes
necessary to analyze and appreciate all those circumstances
which might disguise the real origin
of fossil remains; and it rarely happens that people
who have collected bones have been themselves
aware of this necessity, the consequence of which
has been, that the true characters of their geological
position have been almost always neglected
or misunderstood.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there are some doubtful species, which
must occasion more or less uncertainty in the results
of our researches, until they have been clearly
ascertained. Thus the horses and buffaloes that
occur along with the elephants, have not yet re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>ceived
appropriate specific characters; and such
geologists as are disinclined to adopt the different
epochs which I have endeavoured to establish with
regard to fossil bones, may, for many years to come,
draw from thence an argument against my system,
so much the more convenient as it is contained in
my own work.</p>

<p>But allowing that these epochs are liable to
some objections, from such as may only consider
some particular case, I am not the less satisfied,
that those who shall take a comprehensive
view of the phenomena, will not be checked by
such inconsiderable and partial difficulties, and
will be led to conclude, as I have done, that there
has been at least one, and very probably two, successions
in the class of quadrupeds, previous to
that which at the present day peoples the surface
of the earth.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Proofs_that_the_Extinct_Species"><em>Proofs that the Extinct Species of Quadrupeds are not
varieties of the presently existing Species.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>I now proceed to the consideration of another
objection, one, in fact, which has already been
urged against me.</p>

<p>Why may not the presently existing races of
land quadrupeds, it has been asked, be modifications
of those ancient races which we find in a
fossil state; which modifications may have been
produced by local circumstances and change of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
climate; and carried to the extreme difference
which they now present, during a long succession
of ages?</p>

<p>This objection must appear strong to those
especially who believe in the possibility of indefinite
alteration of forms in organised bodies; and
who think that, during a succession of ages, and
by repeated changes of habitudes, all the species
might be changed into one another, or might result
from a single species.</p>

<p>Yet to these persons an answer may be given
from their own system. If the species have changed
by degrees, we ought to find traces of these
gradual modifications. Thus, between the palæotheria
and our present species, we should be able
to discover some intermediate forms; and yet no
such discovery has ever been made.</p>

<p>Why have not the bowels of the earth preserved
the monuments of so strange a genealogy, if
it be not because the species of former times were
as constant as ours; or, at least, because the catastrophe
which destroyed them, had not left
them sufficient time for undergoing the variation
alleged?</p>

<p>In order to reply to those naturalists who acknowledge
that the <em>varieties</em> of animals are restrained
within certain limits fixed by nature, it
would be necessary to examine how far these limits
extend. This is a very curious inquiry,&mdash;highly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
interesting in itself, under a variety of
relations, and yet one that has been hitherto very
little attended to.</p>

<p>Before entering upon this inquiry, it is proper
to define what is meant by a <em>species</em>, so that the
definition may serve to regulate the employment
of the term. A species, therefore, may be defined,
as comprehending <em>the individuals which descend
from each other, or from common parents,
and those which resemble them as much as they
resemble each other</em>. Thus, we consider as <em>varieties</em>
of a species, only the races more or less different
which may have sprung from it by generation.
Our observations, therefore, regarding the
differences between the ancestors and descendants,
afford us the only certain rule by which
we can judge on this subject; all other considerations
leading to hypothetical conclusions destitute
of proof. Now, considering the <em>varieties</em> in
this view, we observe that the differences which
constitute it, depend upon determinate circumstances,
and that their extent increases in proportion
to the intensity of these circumstances.</p>

<p>Thus, the most superficial characters are the
most variable: the colour depends much upon the
light; the thickness of the fur upon the heat; the
size, upon the abundance of food. But in a wild
animal, even these varieties are greatly limited
by the natural habits of the animal itself, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
does not voluntarily remove far from the places
where it finds, in the necessary degree, all that is
requisite, for the support of its species, and does
not even extend its haunts to any great distance,
unless it also finds all these circumstances conjoined.
Thus, although the wolf and the fox inhabit
all the climates from the torrid to the frigid
zone, we hardly find any other difference
among them, in the whole of that vast space,
than a little more or a little less beauty in
their fur. I have compared skulls of foxes
from the northern countries and from Egypt,
with those of the foxes of France, and have found
no difference but such as might be expected in
different individuals. Such of the wild animals
as are confined within narrower limits, vary still
less, especially those which are carnivorous. The
only difference between the hyena of Persia and
that of Morocco, consists in a thicker or a thinner
mane.</p>

<p>The wild herbivorous animals feel the influence
of climate somewhat more extensively, because
there is added to it in their case, the influence
of the food, which may happen to differ both
as to quantity and quality. Thus, the elephants of
one forest are often larger than those of another;
and their tusks are somewhat longer in places where
their food may happen to be more favourable for
the production of the matter of ivory. The same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
may take place with regard to the horns of rein-deer
and stags. But let us compare two elephants
the most dissimilar, and we shall not discover the
slightest difference in the number and articulations
of the bones, the structure of the teeth, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Besides, the herbivorous species, in the wild
state, seem more restrained from dispersing than
the carnivorous animals, because the sort of food
which they require, combines with the temperature
to prevent them.</p>

<p>Nature also takes care to guard against the alteration
of the species, which might result from
their mixture, by the mutual aversion with which
it has inspired them. It requires all the ingenuity
and all the power of man to accomplish
these unions, even between species that have the
nearest resemblances. And, when the individuals
produced by these forced conjunctions are
fruitful, which is very seldom the case, their fecundity
does not continue beyond a few generations;
and would not probably proceed so far,
without a continuance of the same cares which
excited it at first. Thus, we never see in our
woods individuals intermediate between the hare
and the rabbit; between the stag and the doe; or
between the martin and the pole-cat.</p>

<p>But the power of man changes this order; it
discloses all those variations, of which the type<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
of each species is susceptible; and from them derives
productions which the species, if left to
themselves, would never have yielded.</p>

<p>Here the degree of the variations is still proportional
to the intensity of their cause, which is
slavery. It is not very high in the semi-domesticated
species, such as the cat. A softer fur;
more brilliant colours; greater or less size; these
form the whole extent of the variations in this
species; for the skeleton of an Angora cat differs
in no regular and constant circumstance from
that of a wild cat.</p>

<p>In the domesticated herbivorous animals,
which we transport into all kinds of climates, and
subject to all kinds of management, both with regard
to labour and nourishment, we certainly obtain
greater variations; but still they are all
merely superficial. Greater or less size; longer
or shorter horns, or even the want of these entirely;
a hump of fat, larger or smaller, on the
shoulder; these form the differences between the
various races of the common ox or bull; and these
differences continue long, even in such breeds as
have been transported from the countries in
which they were produced, when proper care is
taken to prevent crossing.</p>

<p>Of this nature are also the innumerable varieties
of the common sheep, which consist chiefly
in differences of their fleeces, as the wool which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
they produce is an important object of attention.
These varieties, although not quite so perceptible,
are yet sufficiently marked among horses.
In general, the forms of the bones vary little;
their connections and articulations, and the forms
of the large grinding teeth, never vary at all.</p>

<p>The small size of the tusks in the domestic
hog, compared with the wild boar’s, and the junction
of its cloven hoofs into one in some races,
form the extreme point of the differences which
we have produced in the domesticated herbivorous
quadrupeds.</p>

<p>The most remarkable effects of the influence
of man are manifested in the animal which he has
reduced most completely under subjection, the
dog,&mdash;that species so entirely devoted to ours, that
even the individuals of it seem to have sacrificed
to us their will, their interest, and inclination.
Transported by man into every part of the world,
subjected to all the causes capable of influencing
their development, regulated in their sexual intercourse
by the pleasure of their masters, dogs
vary in colour; in the quantity of their hair,
which they sometimes even lose altogether, and in
its nature; in size, which varies as one to five in
the linear dimensions, amounting to more than a
hundred fold in bulk; in the form of the ears,
nose, and tail; in the proportional length of the
legs; in the progressive development of the brain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
in the domestic varieties, whence results the form
of their head, which is sometimes slender, with a
lengthened muzzle and flat forehead, and sometimes
having a short muzzle and a protuberant
forehead; insomuch that the apparent differences
between a mastiff and a water-spaniel, and between
a greyhound and a pug, are more striking
than those that exist between any two species of
the same natural genus in a wild state. Finally,
and this may be considered as the maximum
of variation hitherto known in the animal kingdom,
there are races of dogs which have an additional
toe on the hind foot, with corresponding
tarsal bones; as there are, in the human species,
some families that have six fingers on each hand.
Yet, in all these varieties, the relations of the
bones remain the same, nor does the form of the
teeth ever change in any perceptible degree; the
only variation in respect to these latter being,
that, in some individuals, one additional false
grinder appears, sometimes on the one side, and
sometimes on the other<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.</p>

<p>Animals, therefore, have natural characters,
which resist every kind of influence, whether natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
or produced by human interference, and nothing
indicates that, with regard to them, time
has more effect than climate and domestication.</p>

<p>I am aware that some naturalists lay great
stress upon the thousands of ages which they call
into action by a dash of the pen; but, in such
matters, we can only judge of what a long period
of time might produce, by multiplying in idea
what a less time produces. With this view, I
have endeavoured to collect the most ancient documents
relating to the forms of animals; and
there are none which equal, either in antiquity or
abundance, those that Egypt furnishes. It affords
us, not only representations of animals, but
even their identical bodies embalmed in its catacombs.</p>

<p>I have examined with the greatest attention the
figures of quadrupeds and birds sculptured upon
the numerous obelisks brought from Egypt to ancient
Rome. All these figures possess, in their
general character, which alone could be the object
of attention to an artist, a perfect resemblance to
the species represented, such as we see them at
the present day.</p>

<p>On examining the copies made by Kirker and
Zoega, we find that, without preserving every trait
of the originals in its perfect purity, they have
given figures which are easily recognised. We
readily distinguish the ibis, the vulture, the owl,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
the falcon, the Egyptian goose, the lapwing, the
landrail, the aspic, the cerastes, the Egyptian hare
with its long ears, and even the hippopotamus;
and, among the numerous monuments engraved in
the great work on Egypt, we sometimes observe
the rarest animals, the algazel, for example, which
was not seen in Europe until within these few
years<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.</p>

<p>My learned colleague, M. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire,
strongly convinced of the importance of this
research, carefully collected in the tombs and temples
of Upper and Lower Egypt as many mummies
of animals as he could. He has brought
home cats, ibises, birds of prey, dogs, monkeys,
crocodiles, and the head of an ox, in this state;
and there is certainly no more difference to be
perceived between these mummies and the species
of the same kind now alive, than between the human
mummies and the skeletons of men of the
present day. A difference may, indeed, be found
between the mummies of the ibis and the bird
which naturalists have hitherto described under
that name; but I have cleared up all doubts on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
this matter, in a Memoir upon the Ibis, which will
be found at the end of this Essay, and in which I
have shewn that it is still at the present day the
same as it was in the time of the Pharaohs. I
am aware that, in these, I only cite the monuments
of two or three thousand years; but this is
the most remote antiquity to which we can resort
in such a case.</p>

<p>There is nothing, therefore, to be derived from
all the facts hitherto known, that could, in the
slightest degree, give support to the opinion that
the new genera which I have discovered or established
among the fossil remains of animals, any
more than those which have in like manner been
discovered or established by other naturalists, the
<em>palæotheria</em>, <em>anoplotheria</em>, <em>megalonyces</em>, <em>mastodonta</em>,
<em>pterodactyli</em>, <em>ichthyosauri</em>, &amp;c. might have
been the sources of the present race of animals,
which have only differed from them through the
influence of time or climate. Even if it should
prove true, which I am far from believing to be
the case, <ins class="corr" id="tn-112" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'that the fosil'">
that the fossil</ins> elephants, rhinoceroses,
elks, and bears, differ no more from those at present
existing, than the present races of dogs differ
from one another, this would not furnish a sufficient
reason for inferring the general identity of
the species, because the races of dogs have been
subjected to the influence of domestication, which
these other animals neither did nor could experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>Farther, when I maintain that the rocky beds
contain the bones of several genera, and the alluvial
strata those of several species which no longer
exist, I do not assert that a new creation was required
for producing the species existing at the
present day. I only say that they did not originally
inhabit the places where we find them at
present, and that they must have come from some
other part of the globe.</p>

<p>Let us suppose, for instance, that a great irruption
of the sea were now to cover the continent of
New Holland with a coat of sand or other debris;
it would bury the carcases of animals belonging
to the genera <em>Kangurus</em>, <em>Phascolomys</em>, <em>Dasyurus</em>,
<em>Perameles</em>, flying phalanger, echidna, and
ornithorynchus, and it would entirely destroy the
species of all these genera, since none of them exist
now in any other country.</p>

<p>Were the same revolution to lay dry the numerous
narrow straits which separate New Holland
from the continent of Asia, it would open a
road to the elephants, rhinoceroses, buffaloes,
horses, camels, and tigers, and to all the other
Asiatic quadrupeds, which would come to people
a land where they had been previously unknown.</p>

<p>Were some future naturalist, after having
made himself well acquainted with this new race
of animals, to search below the surface on which
they live, he would find remains of quite a different
nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>What New Holland would be, under the circumstances
which we have supposed, Europe, Siberia,
and a large portion of America, now actually
are. And, perhaps, when other countries
shall have been examined, and New Holland among
the rest, it will one day be found that they
have experienced similar revolutions, I might almost
say, mutual changes, of productions. For,
if we push the supposition farther, and, after the
supply of Asiatic animals to New Holland, admit
a second revolution, which destroyed Asia,
their original country, those naturalists who might
observe them in New Holland, their second
country, would be equally at a loss to know
whence they had come, as we now are to find out
the origin of the races of animals that inhabit our
own countries.</p>

<p>I now proceed to apply this manner of reasoning
to the human species.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Proofs_that_there_are_no"><em>Proofs that there are no Fossil Human Bones.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>It is certain that no human bones have yet
been found among fossil remains; and this furnishes
an additional proof that the fossil races
were not mere varieties of known species, since
they could not have been subjected to human influence.</p>

<p>When I assert that human bones have never
been found among fossil organic remains, (I must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
be understood to speak of fossils or petrifactions,
properly so called), or, in other words, in the regular
strata of the surface of the globe; for in peat-bogs
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tourbières</i>), and alluvial deposits, as in
burying-grounds, human bones might as well be
found as bones of horses, or other common species.
They might equally be found in fissures of rocks,
and in caverns, where they may have been covered
over by stalactite; but in the beds which contain
the ancient races, among the <em>palæotheria</em>, and
even among the elephants and rhinoceroses, the
smallest portion of a human bone has never been
discovered. Many of the labourers in the gypsum
quarries about Paris, believe that the bones which
occur so abundantly in them, are in a great part
human; but I have seen several thousands of
these bones, and I may safely affirm that not
one of them has ever belonged to our species. I
have examined at Pavia the groups of bones
brought by Spallanzani from the Island of Cerigo;
and, notwithstanding the assertion of that
celebrated observer, I equally affirm, that there is
not one among them that could be shewn to be
human. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">homo diluvii testis</i> of Scheuchzer
has been restored, in my first edition, to its true
genus, which is that of the salamanders; and, in
a more recent examination of it at Haarlem, allowed
me by the politeness of Mr Van Marum,
who permitted me to uncover the parts enveloped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
in the stone, I obtained complete proof of what I
had before announced. Among the bones found
at Canstadt, the fragment of a jaw, and some articles
of human manufacture, were found; but it is
known that the ground was dug up without any
precaution, and that no notes were taken of the
different depths at which each article was discovered.
Every where else, the fragments of bone
alleged to be human, are found, on examination,
to belong to some animal, whether these fragments
have been examined themselves, or merely
through the medium of figures. Very recently,
some were pretended to have been discovered at
Marseilles, in a quarry that had been long neglected;<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
but they have turned out to be impressions
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tuyaux marines</i>.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Such real human
bones as have been exhibited as fossil, belonged
to bodies that had fallen into fissures, or had been
left in the old galleries of mines, or that had been
incrusted; and I extend this assertion even to
the human skeletons discovered at Guadaloupe,
in a rock formed of fragments of madrepore,
thrown up by the sea, and united by water impregnated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
with calcareous matter.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The human
bones found near Kœstriz, and pointed out by
M. de Schlotheim, had been announced as taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
out of very old beds; but this estimable naturalist
is anxious to make known how much this assertion
is still subject to doubt.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The same has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
been the case with the articles of human fabrication.
The pieces of iron found at Montmartre
are fragments of the tools which the workmen
use for putting in blasts of gunpowder, and which
sometimes break in the stone<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.</p>

<p>Yet human bones preserve equally well with
those of animals, when placed in the same circumstances.
In Egypt, no difference is remarked between
the mummies of men and those of quadrupeds.
I picked up, from the excavations made
some years ago in the ancient church of St Genevieve,
human bones that had been interred below
the first race, which may even have belonged
to some princes of the family of Clovis, and which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
still retained their forms very perfectly<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. We
do not find in ancient fields of battle that the skeletons
of men are more wasted than those of horses,
except in so far as they may have been influenced
by size; and we find among fossil remains the
bones of animals as small as rats, still perfectly
preserved.</p>

<p>Every circumstance, therefore, leads to the conclusion,
that the human species did not exist in
the countries in which the fossil bones have been
discovered, at the epoch of the revolutions by
which these bones were covered up; for there
cannot be a single reason assigned, why men should
have entirely escaped from such general catastrophes,
or why their remains should not be now
found like those of other animals. I do not presume,
however, to conclude that man did not exist
at all before this epoch. He might then have inhabited
some narrow regions, whence he might
have repeopled the earth after those terrible events.
Perhaps also, the places which he inhabited may
have been entirely swallowed up in the abyss,
and his bones buried at the bottom of the present
seas, with the exception of a small number of individuals,
which have continued the species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>However this may be, the establishment of man
in those countries in which we have said that the
fossil remains of land animals are found, that is
to say, in the greatest part of Europe, Asia, and
America, has necessarily been posterior, not only
to the revolutions which have covered up these
bones, but also to those which have laid bare the
strata containing them, and which are the last
that the globe has undergone. Hence it clearly
appears, that no argument in favour of the antiquity
of the human species in these different
countries can be derived either from those bones
themselves, or from the more or less considerable
masses of rocks or of earthy materials by which
they are covered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Physical_Proofs_of_the_Newness"><em>Physical Proofs of the Newness of the Present
Continents.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>On the contrary, by a careful examination of
what has taken place on the surface of the globe,
since it has been laid dry for the last time, and
its continents have assumed their present form,
at least in the parts that are somewhat elevated,
it may be clearly seen that this last revolution,
and consequently the establishment of our existing
societies, could not have been very ancient.
This result is one of the best established, and, at
the same time, one of the least attended to in rational
geology; and it is so much the more valu<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>able,
that it connects natural and civil history in
one uninterrupted series.</p>

<p>When we measure the effects produced in a
given time by causes still acting, and compare
them with those which the same causes have produced
since they have begun to act, we are enabled
to determine nearly the instant at which
their action commenced; which is necessarily the
same as that in which our continents assumed
their present form, or that of the last sudden retreat
of the waters.</p>

<p>It must, in fact, have been since this last retreat
of the waters, that our present steep declivities
have begun to disintegrate, and to form
heaps of debris at their bases; that our present
rivers have begun to flow, and to deposit their
alluvial matters; that our present vegetation has
begun to extend itself, and to produce soil; that
our present cliffs have begun to be corroded
by the sea; that our present downs have begun
to be thrown up by the wind: just as it
must have been since this same epoch, that colonies
of men have begun, for the first or second
time, to spread themselves, and to form establishments
in places fitted by nature for their reception.
I do not here take the action of volcanoes
into account, not only because of the irregularity
of their eruptions, but because we have no
proofs of their not having been able to exist un<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>der
the sea; and because, on that account, they
cannot serve us as a measure of the time which
has elapsed since its last retreat.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Additions_of_Land"><em>Additions of Land by the Action of Rivers.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>MM. Deluc and Dolomieu have most carefully
examined the progress of the formation of
new ground by means of matters washed down
by rivers; and although exceedingly opposed to
each other on many points of the Theory of the
Earth, they agree in this. These formations augment
very rapidly; they must have increased still
more rapidly at first, when the mountains furnished
more materials to the rivers, and yet their
extent is still inconsiderable.</p>

<p>Dolomieu’s Memoir respecting Egypt<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> tends
to prove, that the tongue of land on which Alexander
caused his city to be built, did not exist in
the days of Homer; that they were then able to
navigate directly from the island of Pharos into
the gulf afterwards called <em>Lake Mareotis</em>; and
that this gulf was then, as indicated by Menelaus,
from fifteen to twenty leagues in length.
It had, therefore, only required the nine hundred
years that elapsed between the time of Homer
and that of Strabo, to bring things to the state in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
which this latter author describes them, and to
reduce the gulf in question to the form of a lake,
of six leagues in length. It is more certain, that,
since that time, things have changed still more.
The sand thrown up by the sea and winds have
formed, between the island of Pharos and the site
of ancient Alexandria, a tongue of land two hundred
fathoms in breadth, upon which the modern
city has been built. It has blocked up the nearest
mouth of the Nile, and reduced the lake Mareotis
to almost nothing; while, during the same
period, the alluvial matter carried down by the
Nile, has been deposited along the rest of the
shore, and has greatly increased its extent.</p>

<p>The ancients were not ignorant of these
changes. Herodotus says, that the Egyptian
priests regarded their country as a gift of the
Nile. It is only in a manner, he adds, within a
short period, that the Delta has appeared<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.
Aristotle observes, that Homer speaks of Thebes
as if it had been the only great city in Egypt;
and nowhere makes mention of Memphis<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. The
Canopian and Pelusian mouths of the Nile were
formerly the principal ones; and the coast extended
in a straight line from the one to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
other; and in this manner it still appears in the
charts of Ptolemy. Since then, the water has
been directed into the Bolbitian and Phatnitic
mouths; and it is at these entrances into the sea
that the greatest depositions have been formed,
which have given the coast a semicircular outline.
The cities of Rosetta and Damieta, which were
built upon these mouths, close to the edge of the
sea, less than a thousand years ago, are now two
leagues distant from it. According to Demaillet<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>,
it would only have required twenty-six years to
form a promontory of half a league in extent before
Rosetta.</p>

<p>An elevation is produced in the soil of Egypt,
at the same time that this extension of its surface
takes place, and the bed of the river rises in the
same proportion as the adjacent plains, which
makes the inundations of every succeeding century
pass far beyond the marks which it had
left during the preceding ones. According to Herodotus,
a period of nine hundred years was sufficient
to establish a difference of level amounting
to ten or twelve feet. At Elephantia<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>, the
inundation at present exceeds by seven feet the
greatest heights which it attained under Septimus
Severus, at the commencement of the third<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
century. At Cairo, before it is judged sufficient
for the purpose of irrigation, it must exceed, by
three feet and a half, the height which was necessary
in the ninth century. The ancient monuments
of this celebrated land have all their bases
more or less buried in the soil. The mud left by
the river even covers, to a depth of several feet,
the artificial mounds on which the ancient towns
were built<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>.</p>

<p>The delta of the Rhone is not less remarkable
for its increase. Astruc gives a detailed account
of it in his Natural History of Languedoc; and
proves, by a careful comparison of the descriptions
of Mela, Strabo and Pliny, with the state of the
places as they existed at the commencement of
the eighteenth century, taking into account the
statements of several writers of the middle age,
that the arms of the Rhone have increased three
leagues in length in the course of eighteen hundred
years; that similar additions of land are
made to the west of the Rhone; and that a number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
of places, which were situated, six or eight
hundred years ago, at the edge of the sea or of
large pools, are now several miles distant from
the water.</p>

<p>Any one may observe in Holland and Italy,
with what rapidity the Rhine, the Po, and the
Arno, since they have been confined within dikes,
raise their beds, advance their mouths into the
sea, forming long promontories at their sides;
and judge, from these facts, how small a number
of ages was required by these rivers to deposit the
low plains which they now traverse.</p>

<p>Many cities, which were flourishing sea-ports
at well known periods of history, are now some
leagues inland; and several have even been ruined,
in consequence of this change of position.
The inhabitants of Venice find it exceedingly
difficult to preserve the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lagunes</i>, by which that
city is separated from the continent; and notwithstanding
all their efforts, it will be inevitably
joined to the mainland<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.</p>

<p>We know, from the testimony of Strabo, that
Ravenna stood among lagunes in the time of Augustus,
as Venice does now; but at present Ravenna
is a league distant from the shore. Spina<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
had been built by the Greeks at the edge of the
sea; yet in Strabo’s time it was ninety stadia
from it, and is now destroyed. Adria in Lombardy,
which gave name to the Adriatic sea, and
of which it was, somewhat more than twenty centuries
ago, the principal port, is now six leagues
distant from it. Fortis has even rendered it probable
that, at a more remote period, the Euganian
Mountains may have been islands.</p>

<p>M. de Prony, a learned member of the Institute,
and inspector-general of bridges and roads,
has communicated to me some observations which
are of the greatest importance, as explaining those
changes that have taken place along the shores of
the Adriatic<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. Having been directed by government
to investigate the remedies that might be applied
to the devastations occasioned by the floods
of the Po, he ascertained that this river, since the
period when it was shut in by dikes, has so greatly
raised the level of its bottom, that the surface
of its waters is now higher than the roofs of the
houses in Ferrara. At the same time, its alluvial
depositions have advanced so rapidly into the
sea, that, by comparing old charts with the present
state, the shore is found to have gained more
than six thousand fathoms since 1604, giving an
average of a hundred and fifty or a hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
eighty, and in some places two hundred feet yearly.
The Adige and the Po, are at the present
day higher than the whole tract of land that lies
between them; and it is only by opening new
channels for them in the low grounds, which they
have formerly deposited, that the disasters which
they now threaten may be averted.</p>

<p>The same causes have produced the same effects
along the branches of the Rhine and the
Meuse; and thus the richest districts of Holland
have continually the frightful view of their rivers
held up by embankments at a height of from
twenty to thirty feet above the level of the land.</p>

<p>M. Wiebeking, director of bridges and highways
in the kingdom of Bavaria, has written a
memoir upon this subject, so important as to be
worthy of being properly understood, both by
the people and the government, in all countries
where these changes take place. In this memoir,
he shews that the property of raising the level of
their beds is common in a greater or less degree to
all rivers.</p>

<p>The additions of land that have been made along
the shores of the North Sea, have not been
less rapid in their progress than in Italy. They
can be easily traced in Friesland and in the country
of Groningen, where the epoch of the first
dikes, constructed by the Spanish governor Gaspar
Roblès, is well known to have been in 1570. An<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
hundred years afterwards, land had already been
gained, in some places, to the extent of three
quarters of a league beyond these dikes; and even
the city of Groningen, partly built upon the old
land, on a limestone which does not belong to the
present sea, and in which the same shells are
found as in the coarse limestone of the neighbourhood
of Paris, is only six leagues from the sea.
Having been upon the spot, I am enabled to adduce
my own testimony in confirmation of facts
already well known, and which have been so well
stated by M. Deluc<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. The same phenomenon
may be as distinctly observed along the coasts of
East Friesland, and the countries of Bremen and
Holstein, as the period at which the new grounds
were inclosed for the first time is known, and the
extent that has been gained since can be measured.
This new alluvial land, formed by the rivers and
the sea, is of astonishing fertility, and is so much
the more valuable, as the ancient soil of these countries,
being covered with heaths and peat-mosses, is
almost everywhere unfit for cultivation. The alluvial
lands alone produce subsistence for the many
populous cities that have been built along these
coasts, since the middle age, and which perhaps
would not have attained their present flourishing
condition, without the aid of the rich deposits<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
which the rivers had prepared for them, and which
they are continually augmenting.</p>

<p>If the size which Herodotus attributes to the
Sea of Asoph, which he makes equal to the Euxine<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>,
had been less vaguely indicated, and if we
knew precisely what he meant by the Gerrhus<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>,
we should there find strong additional proofs of
the changes produced by rivers, and the rapidity
with which they are made; for the alluvial depositions
of rivers alone have, since the time of Herodotus,
that is to say, in the course of two thousand
and two or three hundred years, reduced
the Sea of Asoph<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> to its present comparatively
small size, shut up the course of the Gerrhus, or
that branch of the Dnieper which had formerly
joined the Hypacyris, and discharged its waters along
with that river into the gulf called Carcinites,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
now the Olu-Degnitz, and reduced the Hypacyris
itself to almost nothing<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. We should possess
proofs no less strong of the same kind, could we
be certain that the Oxus or Sihoun, which at present
discharges itself into the lake Aral, formerly
reached the Caspian Sea. But we are in possession
of facts sufficiently conclusive on the point
in question, without adducing such as are doubtful,
and without being exposed to the necessity of
making the ignorance of the ancients in geography
the basis of our physical propositions.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Progress_of_the_Downs"><em>Progress of the Downs.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>The downs or hillocks of sand which the sea
throws up on low coasts, when its bottom is
sandy, have already been mentioned. Wherever
human industry has not succeeded in fixing these
downs, they advance as irresistibly upon the land
as the alluvial depositions of the rivers advance
into the sea. In their progress inland, they push
before them the large pools formed by the rain
which falls upon the neighbouring grounds, and
whose communication with the sea is intercepted
by them. In many places they proceed with a
frightful rapidity, overwhelming forests, buildings,
and cultivated fields. Those upon the coast of the
Bay of Biscay<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> have already overwhelmed a great
number of villages mentioned in the records of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
middle age; and at this moment, in the single
Department of the <em>Landes</em>, they threaten ten
with inevitable destruction. One of these villages,
named Mimisan, has been struggling against
them these twenty years, with the melancholy
prospect of a sand-hill of more than sixty feet
perpendicular height visibly approaching it.</p>

<p>In 1802, the pent up pools overwhelmed five
fine farming establishments at the village of St
Julian<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. They have long covered up an ancient
Roman road leading from Bourdeaux to Bayonne,
and which could still be seen forty years ago,
when the waters were low<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>. The Adour, which
is known to have formerly passed Old Boucaut,
to join the sea at Cape Breton, is now turned
to the distance of more than two thousand
yards.</p>

<p>The late M. Bremontier, inspector of bridges
and highways, who conducted extensive operations
upon these downs, estimated their progress
at sixty feet yearly, and in some places at seventy-two
feet. According to this calculation, it will
only require two thousand years to enable them
to reach Bourdeaux; and, from their present extent,
it must have been somewhat more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
four thousand years since they began to be formed<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>.</p>

<p>The overwhelming of the cultivated lands of
Egypt, by the sterile lands of Libya, which are
thrown upon them by the west wind, is a phenomenon
of the same nature with the downs. These
sands have destroyed a number of cities and villages,
whose ruins are still to be seen; and this
has happened since the conquest of the country
by the Mahometans, for the summits of the minarets
of some mosques are seen projecting beyond
the sand<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>. With a progress so rapid, they
would, without doubt, have filled up the narrow
parts of the valley, if so many ages had elapsed
since they began to be thrown into it<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>; and there
would no longer remain any thing between the
Libyan chain and the Nile. Here, then, we have
another natural chronometer, of which it would
be as easy as interesting to obtain the measure.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Peat-Mosses_and_Slips"><em>Peat-Mosses and Slips.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>The turbaries, or peat-mosses, which have
been found so generally in the northern parts of
Europe, by the accumulation of the remains of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
<em>sphagna</em> and other aquatic mosses, also afford a
measure of time. They increase in height in
proportions which are determinate with regard
to each place. They thus envelope the small
knolls of the lands on which they are formed;
and several of these knolls have been covered over
within the memory of man. In other places the
peat-mosses descend along the valleys, advancing
like glaciers, but differing from them in this respect,
that, while the glaciers melt at their lower
part, the progress of the peat is impeded by nothing.
By sounding their depth down to the solid
ground, we may estimate their age; and we
find, with regard to these peat-mosses, as with regard
to the downs, that they cannot have derived
their origin from an indefinitely remote period.
The same observation may be made with regard
to the slips or fallings, which take place with wonderful
rapidity at the foot of all steep rocks, and
which are still very far from having covered them.
But as no precise measures have hitherto been applied
to these two agents, we shall not insist upon
them at greater length<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>From all that has been said, it may be seen
that nature uniformly speaks the same language,
everywhere informing us that the present order of
things cannot have commenced at a very remote
period. And, what is very remarkable, mankind
everywhere speaks as nature, whether we consult
the received traditions of the various nations, or
examine their moral and political state, and the
intellectual attainments which they had made at
the period when their authentic records commence.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_History_of_Nations"><em>The History of Nations confirms the Newness of the
Continents.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>In fact, although, at the first glance, the traditions
of some ancient nations, which extend their
origin to so many thousands of ages, appear
strongly to contradict this newness of the world, as
it exists at present; yet when we examine these
traditions more carefully, we soon perceive that
they are not sufficiently authenticated. We are,
on the contrary, quickly convinced, that true history,
deserving that name, and all that has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
preserved of positive documents regarding the
first establishment of nations, confirm what has
been announced by the natural monuments already
mentioned.</p>

<p>The chronology of none of the western nations
can be traced in a continuous line farther back
than 3000 years. None of them afford us, previous
to that period, nor even two or three centuries
after, a series of facts connected with any
degree of probability. The north of Europe possesses
no authentic records which bear a remoter
date than that of its conversion to Christianity.
The history of Spain, of Gaul, and of England,
commences only at the period when these countries
were conquered by the Romans; that of
northern Italy is, at the present day, almost unknown.
The Greeks acknowledge that they did
not possess the art of writing, until it was taught
them <ins class="corr" id="tn-138" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'by the Phenicians'">
by the Phœnicians</ins>, fifteen or sixteen centuries
before the Christian era; even for a long
time after, their history is full of fables; and
they do not assign a more remote date than 300
years farther back, to their uniting into distinct
tribes. Of the history of Western Asia, we have
only a few contradictory extracts, which do not,
with any connection, give a greater antiquity
than twenty-five centuries<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>; and even if we admit
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
the few historical details which refer to more
remote periods, it can scarcely be extended to
forty<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.</p>

<p><em>Herodotus</em>, the first profane historian whose
works have been transmitted to us, has not a
greater antiquity than 2300 years<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>. The historians,
prior to him, whom he may have consulted,
do not date a century before him<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>. We may
even judge of what they were by the extravagances
handed down to us, extracted from the works
of <em>Aristæus</em> of Proconnesus, and some others.
Before them we have only poets; and <em>Homer</em>,
the most ancient that we possess, Homer the
immortal master and model of all the West,
flourished only twenty-seven or twenty-eight centuries
before the present time.</p>

<p>When these first historians speak of ancient
events, whether occurring in their own nation, or
in neighbouring countries, they only cite oral
traditions, and not public works. It was not until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
a long time after them, that pretended extracts
were given from the Egyptian, Phenician,
and Babylonian annals. <em>Berosus</em> wrote only in
the reign of Seleucus Nicanor; <em>Hieronymus</em> in
that of Antiochus Soter, and <em>Manetho</em> under
Ptolemy Philadelphia; the whole three having
flourished only in the third century before the
Christian era. That <em>Sanconiatho</em> was an author
real or supposed, was not known till Philo of
Byblos had published a translation of his work
in the reign of Adrian, in the second century before
Christ; and, when he did become known,
there was nothing found in his account of the
early ages, as in those of all the authors of this
kind, but a puerile theogony, or metaphysical
doctrines, so disguised under the form of allegory
as to be unintelligible.</p>

<p>One nation alone has preserved annals written
in prose before the period of Cyrus, namely, the
Jewish people. The part of the Old Testament
which is known by the name of the <em>Pentateuch</em>,
has existed in its present form, at least since the
separation of the ten tribes under Jeroboam, since
it was received as authentic by the Samaritans
equally as the Jews, which assures us that its actual
antiquity is upwards of 2800 years. Besides
this, we have no reason to doubt the book of Genesis
having been composed by Moses himself,
which gives it an antiquity of 500 years more, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
of thirty-three centuries; and it is only necessary
to read it, to perceive that it has in part been
composed of fragments of previously existing works.
We cannot, therefore, hesitate to admit, that this
is the most ancient writing which has been transmitted
to modern times in the West<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.</p>

<p>Now, this work, and all those which have been
composed since, whatever strangers their authors
might be to Moses and his people, speak of the
nations on the shores of the Mediterranean as of
recent origin; they represent them as still in a
half savage state some ages before. And, further,
they all speak of a general catastrophe, an irruption
of the waters, which occasioned an almost
total regeneration of the human race; and to this
epoch they do not assign a very remote antiquity.
Those texts of the Pentateuch, which extend
this epoch the longest, do not place it farther
back than twenty centuries before Moses, and
hence not more than 5400 years before the present
day<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>.</p>

<p>In the poetical traditions of the Greeks, from
which is derived the whole of our profane history
with reference to those remote ages, there is nothing
which contradicts the Jewish annals. On the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
contrary, they have a wonderful agreement with
them, by the epoch which they assign to the
Egyptian and Phenician colonies, by which the
first germs of civilization were carried into Greece.
We find that, about the same period when the
Israelites took their departure from Egypt, to
carry into Palestine the sublime doctrine of the
unity of God, other colonies issued from the same
country, to carry into Greece a religion less pure,
at least in its external character, whatever might
have been the secret doctrines which it reserved
for the initiated; while others, again, came from
Phenicia, and imparted to the Greeks the art of
writing, and whatever was connected with navigation
and commerce<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>It is undoubtedly far from being the case, that
we have had since that time a connected history,
since we still find, for a long period after these
founders of colonies, a multitude of mythological
events, and adventures, in which gods and heroes
are concerned; and these chiefs are connected
with authentic history only by means of genealogies
evidently fictitious<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>. And, it is still more
certain, that whatever preceded their arrival,
could only have been preserved in very imperfect
traditions, and supplied by mere fictions, similar
to those of our monks of the middle age regarding
the origin of the European nations.</p>

<p>Thus, not only should we not be surprised to
find, even in ancient times, many doubts and
contradictions respecting the epochs of Cecrops,
Deucalion, Cadmus and Danaus; and not only
would it be childish to attach the smallest importance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
to any opinion whatever, regarding the
precise dates of Inachus<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> or Ogyges<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>; but, if
any thing ought to surprise us, it is this,&mdash;that an
infinitely more remote antiquity had not been assigned
to those personages. It is impossible that
there has not been in this case some effect of the
influence of received traditions, from which the
inventors of fables were not able to free themselves.
One of the dates assigned to the deluge
of Ogyges, even agrees so much with one of those
which have been attributed to the deluge of
Noah, that it is almost impossible it should not
have been derived from some source, where this
latter deluge had been the one intended to be
spoken of<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>As to Deucalion, whether this prince be regarded
as a real or fictitious personage, however
little we enter into the manner in which his deluge
has been introduced into the poems of the
Greeks, and the various details with which it becomes
successively enriched, we perceive that it
was nothing else than a tradition of the great cataclysm,
altered and placed by the Hellenians in
the period which they also assigned to Deucalion,
because he was regarded as the founder of
their nation, and because his history is confounded
with that of all the chiefs of the renewed nations<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>Each of the different colonies of Greece, that
had preserved isolated traditions, commenced
them with a particular deluge of its own, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
some remembrance of the general deluge common
to all the nations, was preserved among each of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
the tribes; and, when it was afterwards attempted
to reduce these various traditions to a common
chronology, different events were imagined to
have been recorded, from the circumstance that
dates, in reality uncertain, or perhaps altogether
false, although considered as authentic in the
countries where they originated, were not found
to agree with each other. Thus, in the same
manner that the Hellenes had a deluge of Deucalion,
because they regarded him as the founder
of their nation, the Autochtones of Attica had
one of Ogyges, because it was with him that their
history commenced. The Pelasgi of Arcadia
had that which, according to later authors, compelled
Dardanus to retire towards the Hellespont.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
The island of Samothracia, one of those
in which a succession of priests had been more
anciently established, together with a regular
worship and connected traditions, had also a deluge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
which passed for the most ancient of all<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>,
and which was attributed to the bursting of the
Bosphorus and the Hellespont. Some idea of a
similar event was preserved in Asia Minor<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>, and
in Syria<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>, and to this the Greeks would afterwards
naturally attach the name of Deucalion<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.</p>

<p>But none of these traditions assign <ins class="corr" id="tn-149" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'a very reremote'">
a very remote</ins>
antiquity to this cataclysm; and there is
none of them that does not admit of explanation,
in so far as its date and other circumstances are
concerned, from the variations to which narratives,
that are not fixed by writing, must be continually
liable.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_very_remote_Antiquity"><em>The very remote Antiquity attributed to certain Nations
is not supported by History.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>Those who would attribute to the continents
and the establishment of nations, a very remote
antiquity, are therefore obliged to have recourse
to the Indians, Chaldeans, and Egyptians, three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
nations, in fact, which appear to have been the
most anciently civilized of the Caucasian Race,
and having a remarkable similarity, not only in
their temperament, and in the climate and nature
of the countries which they occupied, but
also in their political and religious constitution,
but whose testimony this almost identical constitution
ought to render equally suspected<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.</p>

<p>These three nations agreed in having each a
hereditary caste, to which the care of religion,
laws, and science, was exclusively consigned. In
all of them, this caste had its allegorical language
and secret doctrines; and in all it reserved to itself
the privilege of reading and explaining the
sacred books, the whole doctrines of which had
been revealed by the gods themselves.</p>

<p>We can easily conceive what history would necessarily
come to in such hands; but, without
having recourse to any great efforts of reason, we
may learn it from the fact itself, by examining
what it has come to in the only one of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
three nations which still exists, namely, the Indians.</p>

<p>The truth is, that history does not exist at all
among them. In the midst of that infinity of books
on mystical theology and abstract metaphysics
which the Brahmins possess, and many of which
have been made known to us by the ingenious perseverance
of the English, we find no connected
account of the origin of their nation, or of the
vicissitudes of their society. They even pretend
that their religion prohibits them from recording
the events of the present time, their age of misfortune<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.</p>

<p>According to the Vedas, the first revealed
works, on which are founded the whole religious
opinions of the Hindoos, the literature of this
people, like that of the Greeks, had its origin at
two great epochs; the Ramaian and the Mahabarat,&mdash;a
thousand times more monstrous in their
wonders than the Iliad and Odyssey, but in
which we also perceive some traces of a metaphysical
doctrine of that description generally
termed sublime. The other poems, which, together
with the two mentioned, compose the great
body of the Pouranas, are nothing else than metrical
legends or romances, written at different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
periods, and by different authors, and not less
extravagant in their fictions than the great poems.
It has been imagined that, in some of these writings,
events and names of men bearing some resemblance
to those spoken of by the Greeks and
Latins, might be discovered; and it is chiefly
from these resemblances of names that Mr Wilfort
has attempted to extract from the Pouranas
a kind of concordance with our ancient chronology
of the west; a concordance which, in every
line, betrays the hypothetical nature of its basis,
and which, moreover, can only be admitted by
absolutely rejecting the dates given in the Pouranas
themselves<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.</p>

<p>The list of kings which the Indian pundits or
doctors pretend to have compiled according to
these Pouranas, are nothing but mere catalogues
without any details, or adorned with absurd ones,
like those of the Chaldeans and Egyptians, and
like those which Trithemus and Saxo Grammaticus
have made up for the northern nations<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
These lists are far from corresponding; none of
them supposes a history, or registers, or records;
the very basis on which they rest may have been
purely imagined by the poets from whose works
they have been extracted. One of the pundits
who furnished Mr Wilfort with them, acknowledged
that he had arbitrarily filled up the spaces
between the celebrated kings with imaginary
names<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>, and avowed that his predecessors had
done the same. If this be true of the lists obtained
by the English at the present day, how
should it not be so of those given by Abou-Fazel,
as extracts from the annals of Cachmere<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>,
and which, besides, full of fables as they are, do
not extend farther back than 4300 years, of
which more than 1200 are occupied with names
of princes whose reigns, in as far as regards their
duration, remain undetermined.</p>

<p>Even the era, accordingly, from which the Indians
count their years at the present day, which
commences fifty-seven years before Christ, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
which bears the name of a prince called <em>Vicramaditjia</em>,
or <em>Bickermadjit</em>, bears it only by a sort of
convention; for we find, according to the synchronisms
attributed to Vicramaditjia, that there
may have been at least three, and perhaps so
many as eight or nine, princes of this name, who
have all similar legends, and who have all waged
war with a prince named <em>Saliwahanna</em>; and,
further, we cannot well make out whether this
period, the fifty-seventh year before the Christian
era, is that of the birth, reign, or death of the
hero whose name it bears.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, the most authentic books of the Indians,
contradict, by intrinsic and very obvious
characters, the antiquity attributed to them by
the pundits. Their <em>vedas</em>, or sacred books, alleged
by them to have been revealed by Brama
himself from the beginning of the world, and arranged
by <em>Viasa</em> (a name which signifies nothing
else than collector), at the commencement
of the present age, if we judge of them by the
calendar which is found annexed, and to which
they refer, as well as by the position of the colures
indicated by this calendar, may extend to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
3200 years, or about the epoch of Moses.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Nay,
perhaps those who give credit to the assertion of
Megasthenes<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>, that in his time the Indians were
not acquainted with the art of writing, who reflect
that none of the ancients has made mention
of their superb temples, those immense pagodas,
the remarkable monuments of the religion of <ins class="corr" id="tn-155" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the Bramins, and'">
the Brahmins, and</ins> who are aware that the epochs of
their astronomical tables have been calculated
backwards, and ill calculated, and that their treatises
of astronomy are modern and antedated,
will be inclined still farther to reduce the pretended
antiquity of the Vedas.</p>

<p>Yet even in the midst of all the Brahminical
fictions, circumstances occur, whose agreement
with the result of the historical monuments of
more western countries cannot but astonish us.
Thus, their mythology consecrates the successive
devastations which the surface of the globe has
already undergone, or is yet destined to undergo;
and it is only to a period somewhat less than
5000 years, that they refer the last catastrophe.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
One of these revolutions, which is in reality
placed much farther from us, is described in terms
nearly corresponding with those of Moses<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>. Mr
Wilfort even assures us, that, in another event of
the same mythology, a conspicuous place is held
by a personage who resembles Deucalion, in his
origin, name, and adventures, and even in the
name and adventures of his father<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. It is a circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
equally worthy of remark, that, in the
lists of their kings, imperfect and unauthentic as
they are, they date the commencement of their
first human sovereigns (those of the race of the
sun and moon), at an epoch which is nearly the
same as that from which Ctesias, in his singularly
constructed list, commences the reign of his
Assyrian kings<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.</p>

<p>This deplorable state of historical knowledge
was necessarily the result of the system of a
people, among whom the exclusive privilege of
writing, of preserving, and of explaining the
books, was given to the hereditary priests of a
religion monstrous in its ritual, and cruel in its
maxims. Some legend made up for the purpose
of establishing a place of pilgrimage, inventions
adapted to impress more deeply a respect for their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
caste, must have interested these priests more
than any historical truths. Of the sciences, they
might have cultivated astronomy, which would
give them credit as astrologers; mechanics, which
would assist them in raising their monuments,
those signs of their power, and objects of the
superstitious veneration of the people; geometry,
the basis of astronomy, as well as of mechanics,
and an important auxiliary to agriculture in those
vast plains of alluvial formation, which could
only be rendered healthy and fertile by the aid
of numerous canals. They might have encouraged
the mechanical or chemical arts, which
supported their commerce, and contributed to
their luxury, and the magnificence of their temples.
But history, which informs men of their
mutual relations, would be regarded by them with
dread.</p>

<p>What we see in India, we might therefore expect
to find in general, wherever sacerdotal races,
constituted like those of the Brahmins, and established
in similar countries, assumed the same
empire over the mass of the people. The same
causes produce the same effects; and, in fact, we
have only to glance over the fragments of Egyptian
and Chaldean traditions which have been
preserved, to be convinced that there is no more
historical authenticity in them than in those of
the Indians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>In order to judge of the nature of the chronicles
which the Egyptian priests pretended to
possess, it is only necessary to review the extracts
which have been given by themselves at different
periods, and to different individuals.</p>

<p>Those of <em>Sais</em>, for example, informed Solon,
about 550 years before Christ, that, as Egypt
was not subject to deluges, they had preserved
not only their own annals, but those of other nations
also; that the cities of Athens and Sais had
been built by Minerva, the former 9000 years
before, the latter only 8000; and to these dates
they added the well known fables respecting the
Atlantes, and the resistance which the ancient
Athenians opposed to their conquests, together
with the whole romantic description of the Atlantis<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>,
a description in which we find events
and genealogies similar to those of all mythological
romances.</p>

<p>A century later, about 450 years before Christ,
the priests of Memphis gave entirely different
accounts to Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>. Menes, the first king
of Egypt, according to them, had built Memphis,
and inclosed the Nile within dikes, as if it were
possible that the first king of a country could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
perform operations of this kind. Between this
prince and Mœris, who, according to them,
reigned 900 years before the period at which this
account was given (1350 years before Christ),
they had a succession of three hundred and thirty
other kings.</p>

<p>After these kings came Sesostris, who extended
his conquests as far as Colchis<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>; and altogether,
there were, to the time of Sethos, three
hundred and forty-one kings, and three hundred
and forty-one chief priests, in three hundred and
forty-one generations, during a space of 11,340
years. And, in this interval, as if to insure the
authenticity of their chronology, these priests asserted
that the sun had risen twice where he sets,
without any change having taken place in the
climate or productions of the country, and without
any of the gods having at that time, or before,
made their appearance and reigned in
Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>To this fable, which, despite of all the pretended
explanations that have been given of it,
evinces so gross an ignorance of astronomy, they
added, regarding Sesostris, Phero, Helenius, and
Rhampsinitus, the kings who built the pyramids,
and an Ethiopian conqueror named <em>Sabacos</em>, a
set of tales equally absurd.</p>

<p>The priests of Thebes did better: they shewed
Herodotus, and they had before shewn to Hecatæus,
three hundred and forty-five colossal figures
of wood, which represented three hundred and
forty-five high priests, who had succeeded to each
other from father to son, all men, all born the
one of the other, but who had been preceded by
gods<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>. Other Egyptians told him that they had
exact registers, not only of the reign of men, but
also of that of gods. They reckoned 17,000 years
from Hercules to Amases, and 15,000 from Bacchus.
Pan had even been prior to Hercules<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>.
These people evidently took for history some allegories
relating to pantheistic metaphysics, which
formed, unknown to them, the basis of their mythology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>It is only from the time of Sethos that Herodotus
commences the part of his history which is
somewhat rational; and it is worthy of remark,
that this part begins with an event which agrees
with the Hebrew annals, the destruction of the
army of the King of Assyria, <em>Sennacherib</em><a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>; and
this agreement continues under Necho<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>, and under
Hophra or Apries.</p>

<p>Two centuries after Herodotus (about 260
years before Christ) Ptolemy Philadelphus, a
prince of a foreign race, wished to become acquainted
with the history of the country which
events had called him to govern. A priest, called
Manetho, was employed to write it for him. It
was not from registers or archives that he pretended
to compile this work, but from the sacred
books of Agathodæmon, the son of the second
Hermes, and the father of Tat, who had
copied it upon pillars erected before the flood by
Tot or the first Hermes, in the Seriadic land<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>.
And this second Hermes, this Agathodæmon,
this Tat, are personages of whom nothing had
ever been said before, any more than of the Seriadic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
land, or of its pillars. The deluge itself was
an event entirely unknown to the Egyptians of
preceding times, and concerning which Manetho
says nothing in what remains of his dynasties.
The product resembles its source; not only is the
whole full of absurdities, but they are absurdities
peculiar to the work, and utterly irreconcilable
with those which the priests of older times had related
to Solon and Herodotus.</p>

<p>It is Vulcan who commences the series of divine
kings. He reigns 9000 years; the gods and
demi-gods reign 1985 years. The names, and
successions, and dates of Manetho are utterly unlike
any thing that was published before or after
him; and from the discrepancy of the extracts given
by Josephus, Julius Africanus, and Eusebius,
we may infer that his narratives were as obscure
and confused in themselves, as they were discordant
with those of other authors. Even the duration
of the respective reigns of his human kings
is not settled. According to Julius Africanus,
it extended to 5101; according to Eusebius,
to 4723; and according to Syncellus, to 3555
years. It might be thought that the differences
in the names and cyphers arose from the inaccuracy
of copyists; but Josephus quotes a passage at
length, the details of which are manifestly in contradiction
with the extracts of his successors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>A chronicle, named the <em>ancient</em><a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>, and which
some consider anterior, others posterior, to Manetho,
gives still different calculations. The total
duration of its kings is 36,525 years, of which
the sun reigned 30,000, the other gods 3984, and
the demi-gods 217; there remaining for those of
the human race only 2339 years. There are thus
also but 113 generations, in place of the 340 of
Herodotus.</p>

<p>A learned man of an order different from that
of Manetho, the astronomer Eratosthenes, discovered
and published, in the reign of Ptolemy
Euergetes, about 240 years before Christ, a particular
list of thirty-eight kings of Thebes,
commencing with Menes, and continuing for a
space of 1024 years; of which we have an extract
that Syncellus has copied from Apollodorus<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>.
Scarcely any of the names found in this list correspond
with those of the others.</p>

<p>Diodorus went to Egypt in the reign of Ptolemy
Auletes, about sixty years before Christ,
consequently two centuries after Manetho, and
four after Herodotus. He also collected from the
narratives of the priests a history of the country,
and his account is again quite different from
those of his predecessors<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>. It is no longer Menes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
who built Memphis, but Uchoræus; and long before
his time Busiris the second had built Thebes.
The eighth ancestor of Uchoræus, Osymandyas,
possessed himself of Bactria, and crushed rebellions
in it. Long after him, Sesoosis made still
more extensive conquests, having proceeded as far
as the Ganges, and returned by Scythia and the
Tanais. Unfortunately these names of kings are
unknown to all the preceding historians, and none
of the nations which they conquered have preserved
the slightest traces of them. As to the gods
and heroes, their reign, according to Diodorus, extended
through a space of 18,000 years, while
that of the human sovereigns was 15,000. Four
hundred and seventy of the kings were Egyptians,
and four Ethiopians, without reckoning the Persians
and Macedonians. The fables, besides, with
which the whole is intermingled, do not yield in
childishness to those of Herodotus.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth year of the Christian era,
Germanicus, the nephew of Tiberius, led by the
desire of becoming acquainted with the antiquities
of this celebrated land, went over to Egypt,
at the risk of incurring the displeasure of a prince
so suspicious as his uncle, and proceeded up the
Nile as far as Thebes. It was no more Sesostris
or Osymandyas, of whom the priests spoke to him
as a conqueror, but Rhamses, who, at the head of
700,000 men, had invaded Libya, Ethiopia, Me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>dia,
Persia, Bactria, Scythia, Asia-Minor, and
Syria<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, in the celebrated article of Pliny upon
the obelisks<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>, we find names of kings which are
not to be seen elsewhere; Sothies, Mnevis,
Zmarreus, Eraphius, Mestires, a Semenpserteus,
contemporary of Pythagoras, &amp;c. A Ramises,
who might be thought the same as Rhamses, is
there made to live at the time of the siege of
Troy.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether it has been attempted
to reconcile these discordant lists by the supposition
that the kings have borne several names.
For my own part, when I consider not only the
discrepancy of these various accounts, but, above
all, the mixture of authentic facts, attested by
vast monuments, and of puerile extravagancies, it
appears to me much more natural to conclude,
that the Egyptian priests possessed no real history
whatever; that, inferior still to those of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
India, they had not even suitable and connected
fables; that they preserved only lists more or less
defective of their kings, and some remembrances
of the more distinguished among them, of those
especially who had taken care to have their names
inscribed upon the temples and other great edifices
which adorned their country; but that these remembrances
were confused, that they rested
merely upon the traditional explanation which
was given to the representations painted or sculptured
upon the monuments; explanations founded
solely upon hieroglyphical inscriptions, conceived,
like that which has been handed down to
us<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>, in very general terms, and which, passing
from mouth to mouth, were altered, as to their
details, at the pleasure of those who communicated
them to strangers; and that it is consequently
impossible to rest any proposition relative
to the antiquity of the presently existing continents,
upon the shreds of these traditions, so incomplete
even in their own times, and become
utterly unintelligible under the pen of those who
have been the means of transmitting them to
us.</p>

<p>Should this assertion require other proofs, they
would be found in the list of the sacred works of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
Hermes, which were carried by the Egyptian
priests in their solemn processions. Clement of
Alexandria<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> names them all to the number of
forty-two, and there is not even found among
them, as is the case with the Brahmins, one epic
poem, or one book, which has the pretension to
be a narrative, or to fix in any way a single great
action or a single event.</p>

<p>The interesting researches of M. Champollion
the younger, and his astonishing discoveries regarding
the language of the hieroglyphics<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>, far
from overturning these conjectures, on the contrary,
confirm them. This ingenious antiquary
has read, in a series of hieroglyphic paintings in
the temple of Abydos<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>, the prenomens of a certain
number of kings placed in regular succession
one after another; and a part of these prenomens
(the last ten) recurring on various other monuments,
accompanied with proper names, he has
concluded that they are those of kings who bore
those proper names, and this has afforded him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
nearly the same kings, and in the same order, as
those of which Manetho composes his eighteenth
dynasty, that which expelled the shepherds.
The concordance, however, is not complete: in
the painting of Abydos, six of the names that
appear in Manetho’s list are wanting; there are
some, again, which bear no resemblance; and, lastly,
there unfortunately occurs a blank before the
most remarkable of all, the Rhamses, who appears
the same as the king represented on many of the
finest monuments, with the attributes of a great
conqueror. It would be, according to M. Champollion,
in the list of Manetho, the Sethos, the
chief of the nineteenth dynasty, who, in fact, is
indicated as powerful in ships and in cavalry, and
as having carried his arms into Cyprus, Media
and Persia. M. Champollion thinks, with Marsham
and many others, that it is this Rhamses,
or this Sethos, who is the Sesostris, or the Sesoosis
of the Greeks; and this opinion possesses some
probability, in this respect, that the representations
of the victories of Rhamses, probably carried
over the wandering tribes in the vicinity of Egypt,
or at the most into Syria, have given rise to those
fabulous ideas of vast conquests attributed, by
some other confusion, to a Sesostris. But, in
Manetho, it is in the twelfth dynasty, and not in
the eighteenth, that a prince bearing the name of
Sesostris is inscribed, who is noted as having con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>quered
Asia and Thrace<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>. Marsham also asserts,
that this twelfth dynasty and the eighteenth make
but one<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>. Manetho could not himself, therefore,
have understood the lists which he copied. Lastly,
if we admit in their full degree, both the historical
truth of this bas-relief of Abydos, and its
accordance, whether with the part of Manetho’s
lists that seems to correspond to it, or with the
other hieroglyphic inscriptions, this consequence
would result, that the pretended eighteenth dynasty,
the first regarding which the ancient chronologists
begin to manifest some agreement, is
also the first which has left traces of its existence
upon monuments. Manetho may have consulted
this document and others of a like nature; but it
is not the less obvious, that a mere list, a series of
names or of portraits, as he has throughout, is far
from being a history.</p>

<p>Ought not this, then, which is proved and demonstrated
with respect to the Indians, and
which I have rendered so probable with respect
to the inhabitants of the valley of the Nile, be
presumed also to be the case with those of the
valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris? Established,
like the Indians<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> and Egyptians, upon a much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
frequented route of commerce, in vast plains, which
they had been obliged to intersect with numerous
canals; instructed, like them, by hereditary
priests, the pretended depositaries of secret books,
the privileged possessors of the sciences, astrologers,
builders of pyramids, and other great monuments<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>;
should they not also resemble them in
other essential points? Should not their history
be equally a mere collection of legendary tales? I
venture almost to assert, that not only is this probable,
but that it is actually demonstrated.</p>

<p>Up to this period neither Moses nor Homer
speak of any great empire in Upper Asia. Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
gives to the supremacy of the Assyrians a duration
of only 520 years, and does not attribute to
their origin a greater antiquity than about eight
centuries before his own time. After having
been at Babylon, where he consulted the priests,
he had not even learnt the name of Ninus as king
of the Assyrians, and does not mention him
otherwise than as the father of Agro<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>, the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
Lydian king of the family of the Heraclides.
Notwithstanding, he makes him the son of Belus:
so much confusion had there been in the
traditions. Though he speaks of Semiramis as one
of the queens who left great monuments in Babylon,
he only places her seven generations before
Cyrus.</p>

<p>Hellanicus, who was cotemporary with Herodotus,
far from allowing that Semiramis had
built any thing at Babylon, attributes the foundation
of that city to Chaldæus, the fourteenth
successor of Ninus<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>. Berosus, a Babylonian
and a priest, who wrote scarcely a hundred and
twenty years after Herodotus, gives an astounding
antiquity to Babylon; but it is to Nabuchodonosor,
a prince comparatively very modern, that he
attributes the principal monuments<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>. Regarding
even Cyrus, a prince so remarkable, and whose
history must have been so well known and so
popular, Herodotus, who only lived a hundred
years after him, owns that, in his time, there already
existed three different opinions; and, in
fact, sixty years later, Xenophon gives a biography
of this prince quite at variance with that of
Herodotus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>Ctesias, who was nearly cotemporary with Xenophon,
pretends to have extracted from the royal
archives of the Medes, a chronology which
carries back the origin of the Assyrian monarchy
upwards of 800 years, putting at the head of
their kings, that same Ninus, the son of Belus,
whom Herodotus had made one of the Heraclides;
and, at the same time, he attributes to
Ninus and Semiramis conquests towards the
west, of an extent absolutely incompatible with
the Jewish and Egyptian history of the times in
question<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>.</p>

<p>According to Megasthenes, it was Nabuchodonosor
who made these incredible conquests.
He pushed them by way of Libya, as far as
Spain<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>. We find that, in the time of Alexander,
Nabuchodonosor had completely usurped
the reputation which Semiramis had possessed in
the time of Artaxerxes. But we must suppose,
without doubt, that Semiramis and Nabuchodonosor
had conquered Ethiopia and Libya, much
in the same way as the Egyptians made India
and Bactria to be subdued by Sesostris or Osymandias.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>It would lead to no result were we now to examine
the different accounts respecting Sardanapalus,
in which a celebrated writer imagined he
had found proofs of the existence of three princes
of that name, who were all victims of similar misfortunes<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>;
much in the same way as another
writer found in the Indian Vicramaditjia, at least
three princes, who were equally the heroes of similar
adventures.</p>

<p>It is apparently from the want of agreement
in all these accounts, that Strabo thought himself
justified in saying, that the authority of Herodotus
and Ctesias was not equal to that of Homer
or Hesiod<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>. Nor has Ctesias been more
happy in transcribers than Manetho; and it is very
difficult, at the present day, to harmonize the
extracts made from his writings by Diodorus,
Eusebius, and the Syncelle.</p>

<p>Since there existed such a state of uncertainty
in the fifth century before the Christian era, how
should it be imagined that Berosus had been able
to clear it up in the third century before that era;
or how should we repose more confidence in the
430,000 years which he puts before the deluge, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
the 35,000 years which he places between the deluge
and Semiramis, than in the registers of
150,000 years, which he boasts of having consulted<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>.</p>

<p>Structures raised in remote provinces, and bearing
the name of Semiramis, have been spoken of;
and columns erected by Sesostris<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> have been pretended
to have been seen in Asia Minor, in
Thrace. But, in the same way, in Persia, at the
present day, the ancient monuments, perhaps even
some of the above, bear the name of Roustan;
and in Egypt or Arabia, they bear the names of
Joseph or Solomon. This is an ancient custom
among the eastern nations, and probably among
all ignorant people. The peasants of our own
country give the name of Cæsar’s Camp to all the
remains of Roman entrenchments.</p>

<p>In a word, the more I consider the subject, the
more I am persuaded that there existed no ancient
history at Babylon or Ecbatan, more than
in Egypt and India. And, in place of reducing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
mythology to history, with Evhemere and Bannier,
I am of opinion that a great part of history
should be referred to mythology.</p>

<p>It is only at the epoch of what is commonly
called the Second Kingdom of Assyria, that the
history of the Assyrians and Chaldeans begins to
become more intelligible; and this epoch is also
that at which the history of the Egyptians undergoes
a similar change, when the kings of Nineveh,
of Babylon, and of Egypt, commence their
conflicts on the theatre of Syria and Palestine.</p>

<p>It appears, nevertheless, that the authors of
these countries, or those who had consulted the
traditions regarding them, Berosus, and Hieronymus,
and Nicholas de Damas, agreed in speaking
of a deluge. Berosus has even described it with
circumstances so similar to those detailed in the
book of Genesis, that it is almost impossible what
he says of it should not have been derived from
the same sources, even although he removes its
epoch a great number of ages back,&mdash;insomuch,
at least, as we may judge of it, by the confused
extracts which Josephus, Eusebius, and Syncellus,
have preserved of his writings. But we
must remark, and with this observation we shall
conclude what we have to say with regard to the
Babylonians, that these numerous ages, and this
long series of kings, placed between the deluge
and Semiramis, are a new thing, entirely peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
to Berosus, and of which Ctesias, and those who
have followed him, had no idea, and which has
not even been adopted by any of the profane authors
posterior to Berosus. Justin and Velleius
consider Ninus as the first of the conquerors, and
those who, contrary to all probability, place him
highest, only refer him to a period of forty centuries
before the present time<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>.</p>

<p>The Armenian authors of the middle age
nearly agree with one of the texts of Genesis,
when they refer the deluge to a period of 4916
years from their own time; and it might be
thought that having collected the old traditions,
and perhaps extracted the old chronicles of their
country, they form an additional authority in favour
of the newness of the nations. But when
we reflect that their historical literature commences
only in the fifth century, and that they
were acquainted with Eusebius, we perceive that
they must have accommodated themselves to his
authority, and to that of the Bible. Moses
of Chorene expressly professes to have followed
the Greeks, and we see that his ancient history
is moulded after Ctesias<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>.</p>

<p>However, it is certain, that the tradition of the
deluge existed in Armenia long before the conversion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
of its inhabitants to Christianity; and the
city, which, according to Josephus, was called <em>the
Place of the Descent</em>, still exists at the foot of
Mount Ararat, and bears the name of <em>Nachid-chevan</em>,
which, in fact, has the same signification.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Along with the Armenians, we include the
Arabians, Persians, Turks, Mongolians, and
Abyssinians, of the present day. Their ancient
books, if they ever had any, no longer exist.
They have no ancient history, but that which
they have recently made up, and which they have
modelled after the Bible; hence, what they say
of the deluge is borrowed from Genesis, and adds
nothing to the authority of that book.</p>

<p>It were curious to inquire what had been the
opinion of the ancient Persians upon this subject,
before it was modified by the Christian and Mahomedan
creeds. We find it deposited in their
Boundehesh, or Cosmogony, a work of the time
of Sassanides, (but evidently extracted or translated
from more ancient works), and which was discovered
by Anquetil du Perron, among the
Parsis of India. According to it, the total duration
of the world could only be 12,000 years;
hence it cannot still be very old. The appearance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
of <em>Cayoumortz</em> (the bull-man, the first of
the human race), is preceded by the creation of a
great water.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>For the rest, it would be as useless to expect a
regular history of ancient times from the Parsis,
as from the other eastern nations. The Magi
have left none, any more than the Brahmins or
Chaldeans. Of this there is nothing more required
for proof than the uncertainty which exists regarding
the epoch of Zoroaster. It is even asserted,
that the little history they may have possessed,
that which relates to the Achemenides,
the successors of Cyrus to Alexander, had been
expressly altered, and this in consequence of an
official order to that purpose from a monarch
named Sassanides<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>.</p>

<p>In order to discover authentic dates of the commencement
of empires, and traces of a general deluge,
we must therefore go beyond the great deserts
of Tartary. Toward the east and north we
find another race of men, who differ from us as
much in their institutions and manners as in their
form and temperament. Their language consists
of monosyllables, and they make use of arbitrary
hieroglyphics in writing. They have only a political<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
system of morals, without religion; for the
superstitions of Fo were imported among them
from India. Their yellow skin, their prominent
cheeks, their narrow and oblique eyes, and their
scanty beard, render them so different from us,
that one is tempted to believe that their ancestors
and ours had escaped the great catastrophe on two
different sides. But however this may be, the
epoch which they assign to their deluge is nearly
the same as ours.</p>

<p>The Chou-king is the most ancient of the
Chinese books<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>; it is said to have been compiled
by Confucius, about 2255 years ago, from fragments
of more ancient works. Two hundred
years afterwards, a general persecution of the men
of letters, and destruction of the books, is said to
have taken place under the emperor Chi-Hoang-ti,
whose object in this was to destroy the traces
of the feudal government established under the
dynasty which preceded his. Forty years after,
under the dynasty which had overturned that to
which Chi-Hoang-ti belonged, a portion of the
Chou-king was restored from memory by an old
literatus, and another was discovered in a tomb;
but nearly the half of it was for ever lost. Now,
this book, the most authentic which the Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
possess, commences the history of their country
with the reign of an emperor named <em>Yao</em>, whom
it represents to us as occupied in removing the waters,
<em>which, having risen to the skies, still bathed
the foot of the higher mountains, covered the
less elevated hills</em>, and rendered the plains impassable<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>.
According to some, the reign of Yao
was 4163 years before the present time; according
to others, 3943. The discrepancy in the opinions
regarding this epoch even amounts to 284
years.</p>

<p>A few pages farther on we find one <em>Yu</em>, a minister
and engineer, re-establishing the courses of
the waters, raising embankments, digging canals,
and regulating the taxes of all the provinces in
China, that is to say, in an empire extending 600
leagues in all directions. But the impossibility
of such operations, after such events, shews clearly
that the whole is nothing else than a moral
and political romance<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>.</p>

<p>More modern Chinese historians have added
a series of emperors before Yao, but with a multitude
of fabulous circumstances, without venturing
to assign them fixed epochs. These writers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
are at perpetual variance with each other, even
regarding the number and names of their emperors,
and are not universally approved by their
countrymen. Fouhi, with the body of a serpent,
the head of an ox, and the teeth of a tortoise, together
with his successors, who are not less monstrous,
are altogether absurd, and have no more
existed than Enceladon and Briareus.</p>

<p>Is it possible that mere chance could have produced
so striking a result, as to make the traditional
origin of the Assyrian, Indian, and Chinese
monarchies agree in being referred to an
epoch of nearly 4000 years from the present period?
Would the ideas of nations which have
had so little communication with each other, and
whose language, religion, and laws are altogether
different, have corresponded upon this point, had
they not been founded upon truth?</p>

<p>We could not expect precise dates from the
natives of America, who had no real writings,
and whose oldest traditions extended only to a few
centuries before the arrival of the Spaniards. And
yet, even among them, traces of a deluge are imagined
to be found in their rude hieroglyphics.
They have their Noah, or Deucalion, as well as
the Indians, Babylonians, and Greeks<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>The Negroes, the most degraded race among
men, whose forms approach the nearest to the
brutes, and whose intellect has not yet arrived at
the institution of regular governments, or at any
thing having the least appearance of systematic
knowledge, have preserved no sort of annals or
traditions. They cannot, therefore, afford us any
information on the subject of our present researches,
though all their characters clearly shew
us that they have escaped from the great catastrophe,
at another point than the Caucasian and
Altaic races, from which they had perhaps been
separated for a long time previous to the occurrence
of that catastrophe.</p>

<p>But if the ancients, it is argued, have left no
history, their long existence as nations is not the
less attested by the advances which they have
made in astronomy, by observations whose date is
easily determined, and even by monuments which
still remain, and which themselves bear their
dates. Thus, the length of the year, such as the
Egyptians are supposed to have determined it,
according to the heliacal rising of Sirius, proves
correct for a period comprised between the year
3000 and the year 1000 before Christ, a period
to which the traditions of their conquests and of
the great prosperity of their empire also refer.
This accuracy proves to what perfection they had
carried their observations, and shews that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
had for many ages applied themselves to such investigations.</p>

<p>In order to determine the force of this argument,
it is necessary that we should here enter
upon some explanations.</p>

<p>The solstice is the moment of the year at
which the rise of the Nile commences, and that
which the Egyptians must have observed with
most attention. Having, at the beginning, made,
from imperfect observations, a civil or sacred year
of three hundred and sixty-five days complete,
they would preserve it from superstitious motives,
even after they had perceived that it did not agree
with the natural or tropical year, and did not
bring back the seasons to the same days<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>. However,
it was this tropical year which it behoved
them to mark for the purpose of directing them
in their agricultural operations.</p>

<p>They would, therefore, have to search in the
heavens for an apparent sign of its return, and
they imagined they had found this sign when the
sun returned to the same position, relatively to
some remarkable star. Thus they applied themselves,
like almost all nations who are beginning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
this inquiry, to observe the heliacal risings and
settings of the stars. We know that they chose
particularly the heliacal rising of Sirius, at first,
doubtless, on account of the beauty of the star;
and, especially, because, in those ancient times,
this rising of Sirius being nearly coincident with
the solstice, and indicative of the inundation, was
to them the most important phenomenon of this
kind. Hence it was that Sirius, under the name
of Sothis, occupied so conspicuous a place in their
mythology, and in their religious ceremonies.
Supposing, therefore, that the return of the heliacal
rising of Sirius and the tropical year were
of the same duration, and believing, at length,
that this duration was 365 days and a quarter,
they would imagine a period after which the tropical
year and the old year, the sacred year of
365 days only, would return to the same day; a
period which, according to these incorrect data,
was necessarily 1461 sacred years, and 1460 of
those improved years to which they gave the
name of years of Sirius.</p>

<p>They took for the point of departure of this
period, which they named the Sothiac or great
year, a civil year, the first day of which was, or
had been, also that of a heliacal rising of Sirius;
and it is known, from the positive testimony of
Censorinus, that one of these great years had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
ended in the 138th year of the Christian era<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>.
It had consequently commenced in the 1322d before
Christ, and that which preceded it in the
2782d. In fact, the calculations of M. Ideler
shew, that Sirius was heliacally risen on the 20th
July of the Julian year 139, a day which corresponded
that year to the first of Thot, or the first
day of the Egyptian sacred year<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>.</p>

<p>But not only is the position of the sun, with
relation to the stars of the ecliptic, or the sidereal
year different from the tropical year, on account
of the precession of the equinoxes. The heliacal
year of a star, or the period of its heliacal
rising, especially when it is distant from the
ecliptic, differs still from the sidereal year, and
differs in various degrees according to the latitudes
of the places where it is observed. What
is very singular, however, and the observation has
already been made by Bainbridge<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> and Father
Petau<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>, it happens, by a remarkable concurrence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
in the positions, that, in the latitude of Upper
Egypt, at a certain epoch, and during a certain
number of ages, the year of Sirius was really
within very little of 365 days and a quarter; so
that the heliacal rising of this star returned in
fact to the same day of the Julian year, the 20th
July, in the year 1322 before, and the year 138
after Christ<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>.</p>

<p>From this actual coincidence, at this remote
period, M. Fourier, who has confirmed all these
accounts by new calculations, concludes, that,
since the length of the year of Sirius was so perfectly
known to the Egyptians, they must have
determined it by observations made during a long
series of years, and conducted with great accuracy;
observations which must be referred to at least
2500 years before the present time, and which
could not have been made long before or long after
this interval of time<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>This result would assuredly be very striking,
had it been directly, and by observations, made
upon Sirius itself, that they had fixed the length
of the year of Sirius. But experienced astronomers
affirm it to be impossible that the heliacal
rising of a star could afford a sufficient foundation
for exact observations on such a subject, especially
in a climate where <em>the circumference of the horizon
is constantly so much loaded with vapours,
that, in clear nights, stars of the second
or third magnitude can never be seen within
some degrees of the verge of the horizon, and
that the sun itself is completely obscured at its
rising and setting</em>.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> They maintain, that, if
the length of the year had not been otherwise ascertained,
there would have been a mistake of one
or two days.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> They have no doubt, therefore,
that this duration of 365 days and a quarter, is
that of the tropical year inaccurately determined
by the observation of the shadow, or by that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
the point where the sun rose each day, and
through ignorance identified with the heliacal
year of Sirius; so that it would be mere chance
which had fixed with so much accuracy the duration
of this latter for the period of which we
speak.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps it will also be judged, that men capable
of making observations so exact, and which
they had continued during so long a period,
would not have attributed so much importance to
Sirius, as to pay him religious homage; for they
would have seen that the relations of the rising of
this star with the tropical year, and with the inundation
of the Nile, were merely temporary, and
took place only in a determinate latitude. In
fact, according to M. Ideler’s calculations, in the
year 2782 before Christ, Sirius appeared in Upper
Egypt, on the second day after the solstice;
in 1322, on the third; and in the year 139 after
Christ, on the twenty-sixth.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> At the present
day, its heliacal rising is more than a month after
the solstice. The Egyptians would therefore
set themselves by preference to finding the
period, which would bring about the coincidence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
of the commencement of the sacred year, with
that of the true tropical year, and then they would
discover that their great period must have been
1508 sacred years, and not 1461.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Now, we
assuredly do not find any traces of this period of
1508 years in antiquity.</p>

<p>In general, we may defend ourselves with the
idea, that, if the Egyptians had possessed so long
a series of observations, and of accurate observations
too, their disciple Eudoxus, who studied
among them for thirteen years, would, on his return,
have brought into Greece a system of astronomy
more perfect, and maps of the heavens less
erroneous, and more coherent in their different
parts.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> How should it happen that the precession
of the equinoxes was not known to the
Greeks, but through the works of Hipparchus, if
it had been marked in the registers of the Egyptians,
and inscribed in characters so manifest upon
the ceilings of their temples? And how comes
it that Ptolemy, who wrote in Egypt, should not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
have deigned to avail himself of any of the observations
of the Egyptians?<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>Farther, Herodotus, who lived so long with
them, says nothing of those six hours which they
added to the sacred year, nor of that great Sothian
period which resulted. On the contrary,
he says expressly that the Egyptians, making
their year of 365 days, the seasons returned to
the same point, so that in his time the necessity
of this quarter of a day does not appear to have
been suspected.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Thalles, who had visited the
priests of Egypt, less than a century before Herodotus,
did not, in like manner, make known to
his countrymen, any other than a year of 365
days only.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> And, if we reflect that all the colonies
which migrated from Egypt, fourteen or
fifteen centuries before Christ, the Jews and the
Athenians, carried with them the lunar year, it
will perhaps be inferred that the year of 365
days itself had not existed in Egypt in these remote
ages.</p>

<p>I am aware that Macrobius<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> gives the Egyptians
a solar year of 365¼ days; but this author,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
who is comparatively modern, and who lived at a
long period after the establishment of the fixed
year of Alexandria, must have confounded the
epochs. Diodorus<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> and Strabo<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> only attribute
such a year to the Thebans; they do not say
that it was in general use, and they themselves
did not live till long after Herodotus.</p>

<p>Thus the Sothian or great year must have been
a comparatively recent invention, since it results
from the comparison of the civil year with this
pretended heliacal year of Sirius; and it is for
this reason that it is only spoken of in the works
of the second and third century after Christ<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>, and
that Syncellus alone, in the ninth, seems to cite
Manetho as having made mention of it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all that is said to the contrary,
the same opinion must be formed of the astronomical
knowledge of the Chaldeans. It is natural
enough to think, that a people who inhabited
vast plains, under a sky perpetually serene,
must have been led to observe the course of the
stars, even at a period when they still led a wandering
life, and when the stars alone could direct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
their courses during the night; but since what
period were they astronomers, and to what perfection
did they carry the science? Here rests the
question. It is generally allowed that Callisthenes
sent to Aristotle observations made by them,
and which referred to a period of 2200 years before
Christ; but this fact is related only by Simplicius<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>,
as stated upon the authority of Porphyry,
and 600 years after Aristotle. Aristotle
himself says nothing on the subject, nor has any
creditable astronomer spoken of it. Ptolemy
mentions and makes use of ten observations of
eclipses really made by the Chaldeans; but they do
not refer to an earlier period than that of Nabonassar
(721 years before Christ); they are inaccurate
also; the time is expressed only in hours and
half-hours, and the shadow only in halves or
fourths of the diameter. Notwithstanding, as
they had fixed dates, the Chaldeans must have
had some knowledge of the true length of the
year, and some means of measuring time. They
appear to have known the period of eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
years, which brings back the eclipses of the moon
in the same order; a piece of knowledge which the
mere inspection of their registers would promptly
afford them; but it is certain that they could
neither explain nor predict eclipses of the sun.</p>

<p>It is from not having sufficiently understood a
passage of Josephus, that Cassini, and after him
Bailly, have imagined that they discovered in it
a luni-solar period of 600 years, which had been
known from the time of the first patriarchs<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus every thing leads us to believe that the
great reputation of the Chaldeans was given them
at a more recent period, by their unworthy successors,
who, under the same name, sold their horoscopes
and predictions throughout the whole
Roman empire, and who, in order to procure
themselves more credit, attributed to their rude
ancestors the honour of the discoveries of the
Greeks.</p>

<p>With regard to the Indians, every body knows
that Bailly, believing that the epoch which is
used as a period of departure in some of their astronomical
tables had been actually observed, has
attempted to draw from thence a proof of the
great antiquity of the science among this people,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
or at least among the nation which had bequeathed
them its knowledge. But the whole of this
system, invented with so much labour, falls to the
ground of itself, now that it is proved that this
epoch has been adopted but of late, from calculations
made backwards, and even false in their results.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>Mr Bentley has discovered that the tables of
Tirvalour, on which the assertion of Bailley especially
rested, must have been calculated about
1281 of the Christian era, or 540 years ago, and
that the Surya-Siddhanta, which the Brahmins
regard as their oldest scientific treatise on astronomy,
and which they pretend to have been revealed
upwards of 20,000,000 of years ago, could
not have been composed at an earlier period than
about 760 years from the present day<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>.</p>

<p>Solstices and equinoxes indicated in the Pouranas,
and calculated according to the positions
which seem to be attributed to them by the signs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
of the Indian zodiac, such as they are supposed to
be, have acquired the character of an enormous
antiquity. A more attentive examination of
these signs or nacchatras has lately convinced M.
de Paravey that reference is only made to solstices
of 1200 years before the Christian era. This
author at the same time admits, that the place of
the solstices is so inaccurately fixed, that this determination
of their date must be received with a
latitude of 200 or 300 years. They are in the
same predicament as those of Eudoxus and of
Tcheoukong<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>.</p>

<p>It is ascertained that the Indians do not make
observations, and that they are not in possession
of any of the instruments necessary for that purpose.
M. Delambre indeed admits, with Bailly
and Legentil, that they have processes of calculation,
which, without proving the antiquity of
their astronomy, shew at least its originality<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>; and
yet this conclusion can by no means be extended
to their sphere; for, independently of their twenty-seven
nacchatras or lunar houses, which strongly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
resemble those of the Arabians, they have the
same twelve constellations in the zodiac as the
Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Greeks<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>; and, if we
refer to Mr Wilfort’s assertions, their extra-zodiacal
constellations are also the same as those of
the Greeks, and bear names which are merely
slight alterations of their Greek names<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>.</p>

<p>It is to Yao that the introduction of astronomy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
into China is attributed. He is represented,
in the Chou-king, as sending astronomers toward
the four cardinal points of his empire, to examine
what stars presided over the four seasons, and to
regulate the operations to be carried on at each
period of the year<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>, as if their dispersion was necessary
for such an undertaking. About 200
years later, the Chou-king speaks of an eclipse of
the sun, but accompanied with ridiculous circumstances,
as in all the fables of this kind; for the
whole Chinese army, headed by a general, is made
to march against two astronomers, because they
had not properly predicted it<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>; and it is well
known that, more than 2000 years after, the Chinese
astronomers possessed no means of accurately
predicting the eclipses of the sun. In 1629 of
our era, at the time of their dispute with the Jesuits,
they did not even know how to calculate the
shadows.</p>

<p>The real eclipses, recorded by Confucius in his
Chronicle of the kingdom of Lou, commence only
1400 years after this, in the 776th before Christ,
and scarcely half a century earlier than those of
the Chaldeans related by Ptolemy. So true is it,
that the nations which escaped at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
from the general catastrophe, also arrived about the
same period, when their circumstances have been
similar, at the same degree of civilization. Now,
it might be thought, from the identity of the
names of the Chinese astronomers in different
reigns (they appear, according to the Chou-king,
to have all been named <em>Hi</em> and <em>Ho</em>), that, at
this remote epoch, their profession was hereditary
in China, as it was in India, Egypt, and Babylon.</p>

<p>The only Chinese observation of any antiquity,
which has nothing in itself to prove its want of
authenticity, is that of the shadow made by
<em>Tcheou-kong</em> about 1100 years before Christ;
and even it is far from being correct<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>.</p>

<p>Hence our readers may conclude, that the inferences
drawn from the alleged perfection of astronomical
science among ancient nations, is not
more conclusive in favour of the excessive antiquity
of those nations, than the testimonies which
they have adduced in reference to themselves.</p>

<p>But had this astronomy been more perfect,
what would it prove? Has the progress been calculated
which this science ought to make among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
nations who were not in any degree in possession
of others; to whom the serenity of the sky, the
necessities of the pastoral or agricultural life, and
their superstitious ideas, would render the stars
an object of general attention; where colleges, or
societies of the most respectable men among them,
were charged with keeping a register of interesting
phenomena, and transmitting their memory;
and where, from the hereditary nature of the profession,
the children were brought up from the
cradle in the knowledge of facts ascertained by
their parents? Supposing that, among the numerous
individuals of whom the cultivation of astronomy
was the sole occupation, there should happen
to be one or two possessed of extraordinary
talents for geometry, all the knowledge acquired
by these nations might be attained in a few centuries.</p>

<p>Since the time of the Chaldeans, real astronomy
has only had two eras, that of the Alexandrian
school, which lasted 400 years, and that of our
own times, which has not existed so long. The
learned period of the Arabians scarcely added
any thing to it; and the other ages have been
mere blanks with regard to it. Three hundred
years did not intervene between Copernicus and
the author of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mecanique Céleste</cite>; and can
it be believed that the Indians required thousands
of years to arrive at their crude theories?</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Astronomical_Monuments"><em>The Astronomical Monuments left by the Ancients do
not bear the excessively remote dates which have
been attributed to them.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>Recourse has therefore been had to arguments
of another kind. It has been pretended that, independently
of the knowledge which these nations
may have acquired, they have left monuments
which bear a date fixed by the state of the
heavens which they represent, and one that refers
to a very remote antiquity. The zodiacs sculptured
in two temples of Upper Egypt, are adduced
as furnishing proofs perfectly demonstrative
of this assertion. They present the same figures
of the zodiacal constellations as are employed at
the present day, but distributed in a manner peculiar
to themselves. The state of the heavens
at the period when these monuments were delineated,
is imagined to have been represented by
this distribution, and it has been thought that it
would be possible from it to infer the precise period
at which the edifices containing them were
erected<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>But to arrive at the high antiquity which is
supposed to be deducible from this, it must, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
the <em>first</em> place, be supposed, that their division
has a determinate relation to a certain state of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
the heavens, dependent upon the precession of
the equinoxes, which causes the colures to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
the tour of the zodiac in 26,000 years; that it
indicated, for example, the position of the solstitial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
point; and, <em>secondly</em>, that the state of the
heavens represented was precisely that which
took place at the period when the monument was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
erected,&mdash;two suppositions which themselves, as
is evident, suppose a great number of others.</p>

<p>In point of fact, are the figures of these zodiacs
the constellations,&mdash;the true groups of stars which
at present bear the same names, or merely what
astronomers call signs, that is to say, divisions of the
zodiac proceeding from one of the colures, whatever
place this colure occupies? Is the point at
which these zodiacs have been divided into two
bands, necessarily that of a solstice? Is the
division of the side next the entrance, necessarily
that of the summer solstice? Does this
division indicate, even in general, a phenomenon
dependent upon the precession of the equinoxes?
Does it not refer to some period the rotation of
which would be less; for example, to the moment
of the tropical year when such or such sacred years
of the Egyptians commenced, which, being shorter
than the true tropical year by nearly six hours,
would make the tour of the zodiac in 1508 years?
Lastly, whatever signification it may have had,
has it been intended by it to mark the time when
the zodiac was sculptured, or that when the temple
was built? Has not the object been to record
a previous state of the heavens at some period
which was interesting in a religious point of view,
whether it had been actually observed, or inferred
from a retrograde calculation?</p>

<p>From the mere announcement of such questions,
it will be perceived how complicated they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
necessarily are, how much subject to controversy
any solution that might be adopted on this subject
would be, and how little qualified to serve as a
solid proof, for the solution of another problem,
such as the antiquity of the Egyptian nation.
And it may be said, with regard to those who
have attempted to infer a date from these data,
that there have arisen as many opinions as there
have been authors.</p>

<p>The learned astronomer Mr Burkhard, from a
first examination, judged that, at Dendera, the
solstice is marked by the Lion; which would make
it two signs less remote than at the present day,
and the temple at least 4000 years old<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>. He
gave, at the same time an antiquity of 7000 years
to that of Esne, although it is not known how he
had purposed to reconcile these numbers with
what we know of the precession of the equinoxes.
The late M. Lalande, seeing that the Cancer was
repeated on the two bands, imagined that the solstice
passed to the middle of that constellation;
but as this was the case also in the sphere of Eudoxus,
he concluded that some Grecian artist
might have represented this sphere on the ceiling
of an Egyptian temple, without knowing that it
represented a state of the heavens which no longer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
existed<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>. This, as is seen, was a conclusion
very different from that of Mr Burkhard. Dupuis
was the first who thought it necessary to search
for proofs of the idea, in some measure confidently
adopted, that it was the solstice that was denoted.
He found them, with reference to the great
zodiac of Dendera, in the globe on the top of the
pyramid, and in several emblems placed near different
signs, and which he imagined, sometimes
according to the opinion of ancient authors, such
as Plutarch, Horus Apollo, or Clement of Alexandria,
sometimes according to his own conjectures,
ought to be regarded as representing phenomena
which had been really those of the seasons
affected at each sign. As for the rest, he
maintained that this state of the heavens affords
the date of the monument, and that it is the original,
and not a copy, of the sphere of Eudoxus,
that was represented at Dendera, which would
refer it to a period of 1468 years before Christ,
or to the reign of Sesostris. The number of nineteen
boats, however, placed under each band, furnished
him with the idea that the solstice might
probably have been at the nineteenth degree of
the sign, which would make it 288 years older<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>Mr Hamilton<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> having remarked, that, at Dendera,
the Scarabæus belonging to the side of the
ascending signs is smaller than that of the other
side, an English author<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> has concluded from this
that the solstice may have been nearer its actual
point than the middle of the Cancer, which would
carry us back to a period of 1000 or 1200 years
before Christ.</p>

<p>The late M. Nouet, judging that the globe,
the rays, and the horned head, or head of Isis, represent
the heliacal rising of Sirius, supposed that
it was intended to mark an epoch of the Sothian
period, but that it was intended to mark it by the
place which the solstice occupied. Now, in the
last but one of these periods, that which elapsed
between 2782 and 1322 before Christ, the solstice
had passed from 30° 48′ of the constellation of the
Lion to 13° 34′ of Cancer. At the middle of this
period, it was therefore at 23° 34′ of cancer. The
heliacal rising of Sirius happened then some days
after the solstice; and this is nearly what has
been indicated, according to M. Nouet, by the repetition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
of the Scarabæus, and by the figure of Sirius
with the rays of the sun placed at the commencement
of the band to the right. Calculating
upon this basis, he concludes that the temple of
Dendera was built 2052 years before Christ, and
that of Esne 4600<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>.</p>

<p>All these calculations, <ins class="corr" id="tn-211" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'even admiting'">
even admitting</ins> that the
division marks the solstice, would still be susceptible
of many modifications; and, at first, it appears
that their authors have supposed the constellations
all of thirty degrees like the signs, and
have not reflected that it is far from being the
case that they are thus equal, at least as they are
represented at the present day, and as the Greeks
have transmitted them to us. In reality, the solstice,
which is at present on this side of the first
stars of the constellation of Gemini, could only have
left the first stars of the constellation of Cancer
forty-five years before Christ, and had left the
constellation of Leo only 1260 years before the
same era.</p>

<p>“The longitudes of the stars, for 1800, have been
taken from the Berlin Tables, and are those of
Lacaille, Bradley, or Flamstead. The first and the
last of each constellation have been taken, as well
as some of the brightest of the intermediate stars.
The third column indicates the year in which the
longitude of the star was 0′, that is to say, that
in which the star was in the equinoxial colure of
spring. The last column indicates the year when
the star was in the solstitial colure, whether of
winter or of summer.</p>

<p>“For Aries, Taurus, and Gemini, the winter
solstice has been chosen; for the other constellations
the summer solstice has been chosen, for
the sake of not receding into too remote antiquity,
and of not approaching too near modern
times. It will be easy to find the opposite solstice,
by adding the semiperiod of 12,960 years.
The same rule will serve for finding the time
when the star has been, or will be, at the autumnal
equinox.</p>

<p>“The sign - indicates the years before our era,
the sign + the year of our era; and the last line,
at the end of each sign under the title of <em>duration</em>,
gives the extent of the constellation in degrees,
and the time which the equinox, or the
solstice, occupies in traversing the constellation
from one end to the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>“The precession of 50″ yearly has been supposed,
this being the result of the comparison of the
catalogue of Hipparchus with the modern catalogues.
We have thus the advantage of round
numbers, and a general accuracy that may be relied
upon. The entire period is thus 25,920
years; the semiperiod, 12,960 years; the quarter
period, 6480 years; the twelfth, or a sign,
2160 years.</p>

<p>“It is to be remarked, that the constellations
leave empty spaces between them, and that sometimes
they encroach upon each other. Thus, between
the last star of Scorpio, and the first of
Sagittarius, there is an interval of 6⅔ degrees.
On the other hand, the last of Capricorn is more
advanced by 14° in longitude, than the first of
Aquarius. Hence, even independently of the inequality
of the sun’s motion, the constellations
would afford a very unequal and very erroneous
measure of the year and its months. The signs
of 30° furnish a more convenient and less defective
one. But the signs are merely a geometrical
conception; they can neither be distinguished
nor observed; and they are continually changing
place from the retrogradation of the equinoxial
point.</p>

<p>“We have at all times been able to determine,
in a rough manner, the equinoxes and solstices;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
at the long run it has been remarked, that the
appearance of the heavens was no longer exactly
the same that it anciently was at the times of the
equinoxes and solstices. But we have never been
able to observe exactly the heliacal rising of a
star, being always necessarily some days wide of
it; and people frequently speak of it, without
possessing a fixed datum on which to count.
Before Hipparchus, we find nothing, either in
books or in traditions, that can be submitted to
calculation; and it is this which has given rise to
so many systems. Controversies have arisen without
a sufficient knowledge of the subject. Those
who are not astronomers may form ideas as beautiful
as they please of the knowledge of the Chaldeans,
Egyptians, &amp;c.; no real inconvenience will
result. The enterprise and knowledge of the moderns
may be lent to these nations, but nothing
can be borrowed from them; for they have either
had nothing, or they have left nothing. Astronomers
will never derive from the ancients any
thing that can be of the slightest utility. Let us
leave to the learned their vain conjectures, and
confess our utter ignorance respecting things of
little use in themselves, and of which no monument
remains.</p>

<p>“The limits of the constellations vary according
to the authors which we consult. We find these
limits extend or contract, as we pass from Hipparchus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
to Tycho, from Tycho to Hevelius, from
Hevelius to Flamstead, Lacaille, Bradley, or
Piazzi.</p>

<p>“I have said elsewhere, the constellations are
good for nothing, unless at the most to enable us
to mark the stars with more ease; whereas the
stars in particular afford fixed points to which we
can refer the motions, whether of the colures or of
the planets. Astronomy commenced only at the
period when Hipparchus made the first catalogue
of the stars, measured the revolution of the sun,
that of the moon, and their principal inequalities.
The rest presents nothing but darkness, uncertainty,
and gross error. The time would be lost
that were occupied in attempting to reduce this
chaos to order.</p>

<p>“I have given, with the exception of a few
particulars, the whole of my opinion on this subject.
I am nowise anxious about making converts,
for it gives me little concern whether my
ideas be adopted or not; but, if my reasons be
compared with the reveries of Newton, Herschell,
Bailly, and so many others, it is not impossible
but that, in time, these more or less brilliant chimeras
will no longer be relished.</p>

<p>“I have attempted to determine the extent of
the constellations, according to the catasterisms
of Eratosthenes; but the thing is really impossible.
The matter would be still worse were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
we to consult Hygin, and especially Firmicus.
The following is what I have made out from
Eratosthenes.</p>

<p>“As to the Chaldeans, Egyptians, Chinese,
and Indians, there is no want of reveries among
them. One can absolutely make nothing of them.
My opinion with regard to them may be seen in
the preliminary discourse of my History of the
Astronomy of the Middle Age, p. xvii and xviii.

<p>It would still have to be ascertained at what
period the observers ceased to place the constellation
in which the sun entered after the solstice,
at the head of the descending signs, and whether
this was done as soon as the solstice had retrograded
sufficiently to touch the preceding constellation.</p>

<p>Thus MM. Jollois and Devilliers,&mdash;to whose
unremitting zeal we are indebted for an accurate
knowledge of these famous monuments, always
considering the division towards the entrance of
the porch as the solstice, and judging that the
Virgin must have been regarded as the first of the
descending constellations, insomuch as the solstice
had not receded at least so far as the middle
of the constellation of the Lion; and, believing
that they saw farther, as we have mentioned,
that the Lion is divided in the great zodiac of
Esne, have not given to that zodiac a more remote
antiquity than 2160 years before Christ.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>Mr Hamilton, who was the first that observed
this division of the sign of the Lion, in the zodiac<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
of Esne, reduced the distance of the period at
which the solstice occurred there, to 1400 years before
Christ. A great many other opinions have
appeared on the same subject. M. Rhode, for example,
has proposed two. The first refers the
zodiac of the portico of Dendera to a period of
591 years before Christ; the second, to 1290<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>.
M. Latreille has fixed the period of this zodiac
at 670 years before Christ; that of the planisphere
at 550; that of the zodiac of the great
temple of Esne at 2550; and that of the small
one at 1760.</p>

<p>But a difficulty inherent in all the dates, which
proceed on the <ins class="corr" id="tn-222" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'double suppositon'">
double supposition</ins>, that the division
marks the solstice, and that the position
of the solstice marks the epoch of the monument,
is the unavoidable consequence that the zodiac of
Esne must have been at least 2000, and perhaps
3000, years<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> older than that of Dendera, a consequence
which evidently involves the supposition
in ruin; for no one, in any degree acquainted
with the history of the arts, could believe, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
two edifices, so similar in their style of architecture,
could have been erected at periods so remote
from each other.</p>

<p>The feeling of this impossibility, joined always
to the belief that this division of the zodiacs
indicates a date, has given rise to another
conjecture, namely, that the intention had been
to mark the particular sacred year of the Egyptians,
in which the monument had been erected.
As these sacred years consisted only of 365 days,
if the sun, at the commencement of one occupied
the commencement of a constellation, he would
be nearly six hours later in returning to the
commencement of the following year, and, after
121 years, he would only be at the commencement
of the preceding sign. It seems natural
enough that the builders of a temple might wish
to indicate about what period of the great, or Sothian
year, it had been erected; and the indications
of the sign, by which the sacred year then
commenced, was a good enough means. It will
be perceived, that, calculating upon this assumption,
there will be an interval of from 120 to
150 years between the temple of Esne and that
of Dendera. But, in his mode of solving the
problem, there remained to be determined in
which of the great years these buildings had
been erected, whether in that which ended in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
year 138 after, or in that which ended in 1322
before Christ, or in some other.</p>

<p>The late Visconti, who was the first author of
this hypothesis, taking the sacred year, whose
commencement corresponded with the sign of
the Lion, and judging from the resemblance of the
signs, that they had been represented at a period
when the opinions of the Greeks were not unknown
to the Egyptians, was naturally led to make
choice of the end of the last great year, or the space
that elapsed between the year 12 and the year
138 after Christ<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>, which appeared to him to accord
with the Greek inscription, of which, however,
he knew little more than that it was said to
make mention of one of the Cæsars.</p>

<p>M. Testa, seeking the date of the monument
in another order of ideas, went so far as to suppose
that since the Virgin is seen at Esne, at the
head of the zodiac, it was meant thereby to represent
the era of the battle of Actium, such as it
had been established with regard to Egypt, by a
decree of the senate, mentioned by Dion Cassius,
and which commenced in the month of September,
the day on which Alexandria was taken by
Augustus.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>M. de Paravey considered these zodiacs in a
new point of view, which embraced at once both
the revolution of the equinoxes, and that of the
great year. Supposing that the circular planisphere
of Dendera must have been set to the east,
and that the axis from north to south is the line of
the solstices, he found the summer solstice at the
second of the Twins, and that of winter at the
buttock of the Sagittary, while the line of the
equinoxes would have passed through the Fishes
and the Virgin, from which he obtained for date
the first century of our era.</p>

<p>According to this method, the division of the
zodiac of the portico could no longer refer to the
colures, and the mark of the solstice must be
sought for elsewhere. M. de Paravey having
remarked that there are between all the signs
figures of women bearing a star upon their heads,
and marching in the same direction, and observing
that the one which comes after the twins, is
alone turned in a direction contrary to the others,
judged that it indicates the <em>conversion</em> of the
sun or the tropic, and that this zodiac corresponds
in this way with the planisphere.</p>

<p>By applying the idea of easting to the small
zodiac of Esne, the solstices would be <ins class="corr" id="tn-225" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'found bebetween'">
found between</ins>
the Twins and the Bull, and between
the Scorpion and Sagittary; they would even be
marked by the change of direction of the Bull,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
and by the winged Rams placed across at these two
places. In the great zodiac of the same city,
the marks would be the cross position of the
Bull, and the reversed one of the Sagittary.
There would thus be but a portion of a constellation
traversed between the dates of Esne and
those of Dendera, but even this would be still too
long for buildings so closely resembling each other.</p>

<p>An operation of the late M. Delambre upon
the circular planisphere appears to confirm these
conjectures, detracting from its remote antiquity;
for, on placing the stars upon Hipparchus’s
projection, according to the theory of that astronomer,
and according to the positions which he
has given them in his catalogue; and augmenting
all the longitudes, so that the solstice
might pass through the second of the Twins, he
nearly reproduced this planisphere; and “the resemblance,”
says he, “would have been still
greater, had the longitudes been adopted such as
they are in the catalogue of Ptolemy, for the year
123 of our era. On the contrary, by referring to
twenty-five or twenty-six centuries back, the
right ascensions and the declinations will be considerably
changed, and the projection will assume
quite a different figure<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>. All our calculations,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
adds this great astronomer, “lead us to this conclusion,
that the sculptures are posterior to the
epoch of Alexander.”</p>

<p>In reality, the circular planisphere having been
brought to Paris by the care of MM. Saunier
and Lelorrain, M. Biot, in a work founded upon
precise measurements and calculations full of ingenuity,
has determined that it represents, according
to an exact geometrical projection, the
state of the heavens, such as it was 700 years before
Christ; but he by no means concludes that
it had been sculptured at that period<ins class="corr" id="tn-227" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;missing anchor inserted here">
<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>.</ins></p>

<p>In fact, all these efforts of intellect and science,
in so far as they concern the epoch of the monuments,
have become superfluous, since finishing
where they should naturally have begun, if the
first observers had not been blinded by prejudice,
people have taken the trouble of copying and restoring
the Greek inscriptions engraved upon
these monuments, and especially since M. Champollion
has discovered the method of decyphering
those which are expressed in hieroglyphics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>It is now certain, and the Greek inscriptions
agree with the hieroglyphical inscriptions in proving
it, it is certain, we say, that the temples
in which zodiacs have been sculptured, were built
during the time when Egypt was subject to the
Romans. The portico of the temple of Dendera,
according to the Greek inscription of its frontispiece,
is consecrated to the safety of Tiberius<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>.
On the planisphere of the same temple we read
the title of <em>Autocrator</em> in hieroglyphical characters<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>;
and it is probable that it refers to Nero.
The small temple of Esne, that of which the origin
has been placed on the lowest calculation between
2700 and 3000 years before Christ, has a
column sculptured and painted in the sixth year
of Antonine, 147 years after Christ, and it is
painted and sculptured in the same style as the
zodiac which is near it<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>.</p>

<p>Further, we have a proof that this division of
the zodiac, in such or such sign, has no reference
to the precession of the equinoxes, or to the displacement
of the solstice. A mummy case, lately
brought from Thebes by M. Caillaud, and containing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
according to the very legible Greek inscription
upon it, the body of a young man who
died in the ninth year of Trajan, 116 years after
Christ<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>, presents a zodiac divided at the same
point as those of Dendera<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>; and all the appearances
indicate that this division marks some astrological
theme relative to the individual, a conclusion
which may probably be equally applied to
the division of the zodiacs contained in the temples.
It may mark either the astrological theme of
the time of their erection, or that of the prince
to whose safety they had been consecrated, or
such another epoch with relation to which the
position of the sun would have appeared of importance
to be noticed.</p>

<p>Thus are dissipated for ever the conclusions
which people had drawn from some ill explained
monuments, against the newness of the continents
and nations; and we might have dispensed
with treating of them so much in detail had they
not been so recent, and had they not made sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
impression still to retain their influence over
the minds of some individuals.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Zodiac_is_far_from"><em>The Zodiac is far from bearing in itself a certain and
excessively remote date.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>But there are writers who have maintained
that the zodiac bears in itself the date of its invention,
because the names and figures given to
its constellations are an index of the position of
the colures at the time when it was invented;
and this date, according to several, is so evident
and so remote, that it is quite a matter of indifference
whether the representations which we possess
of this circle are more or less ancient.</p>

<p>They do not attend to the circumstance that,
in this sort of argument, there is a complication
of three suppositions equally uncertain: the country
in which the zodiac is presumed to have been
invented, the signification which is supposed to
have been given to the constellations which occupy
it, and the position in which the colures were
with relation to each constellation, when this signification
was attributed to it. According as
other allegories have been imagined, or as these
allegories are admitted to have referred to the
constellation of which the sun occupied the first
degrees, or to that of which it occupied the middle,
or to that into which it began to enter, that
is to say, of which it occupied the last degrees;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
or, lastly, to that which was opposite to him, and
which rose at night; or according as the invention
of these allegories is placed in a different climate,
must the date of the zodiac also be changed.
The possible variations in this respect might
comprehend so much as the half of the revolution
of the fixed stars, that is to say, 13,000 years, and
even more.</p>

<p>In this manner Pluche, generalizing some
indications of the ancients, has imagined, that
the Ram announces the commencement of the
sun’s elevation, and the vernal equinox; that
the Cancer indicates his retrogradation to the
summer solstice; that the Balance, the sign of
equality, marks the autumnal equinox<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>; and
that the Capricorn, a climbing animal, indicates
the winter solstice, after which the sun returns
to us. According to this method, by placing the
inventors of the zodiac in a temperate climate,
we should have rains under Aquarius, the dropping
of lambs and kids under the Gemini, violent
heats under the Lion, gathering of the harvest under
the Virgin, the time of hunting under the Sagittary,
&amp;c.; and the emblems would be appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
enough. If we should then place the colures
at the commencement of the constellations,
or at least the equinox at the first stars of Aries,
we should, in the first instance, arrive at a period
of only 389 years before Christ, an epoch evidently
too modern, and which would render it
necessary to recur to a complete equinoxial period,
or 26,000 years. But if the equinox be
supposed to pass through the middle of the constellation,
a period of about 1000 or 1200 years
higher is obtained, 1600 or 1700 years before
Christ; and this is what several celebrated men
have believed to be the true epoch of the invention
of the zodiac, the honour of which they have,
for other reasons not sufficiently weighty, conferred
upon Chiron.</p>

<p>But Dupuis, who required for the origin which
he endeavoured to attribute to all religions, that
astronomy, and, in particular, the figures of the
zodiac should in some measure have preceded all
other human institutions, has sought another climate
for the purpose of finding other explanations
for the emblems, and for that of deducing another
epoch from them. If, assuming the Balance
as an equinoxial sign, but supposing it at
the vernal equinox, it be presumed that the zodiac
has been invented in Egypt, other sufficiently
plausible explanations might in fact be found for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
the climate of that country.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> The Capricorn, an
animal with the tail of a fish, would mark the
commencement of the rise of the Nile at the summer
solstice; the Aquarius and Fishes, the progress
and diminution of the inundation; the Bull, the
time of labouring; the Virgin, the time of reaping;
and they would mark them at the periods
when these operations actually took place. In
this system, the zodiac would have 15,000 years<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
for a sun supposed at the first degree of each
sign, more than 16,000 for the middle, and 4000
only, on supposing that the emblem has been
given to the sign at the opposite of which the
sun was<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>. It is to the 15,000 years that Dupuis
has attached himself; and it is upon this
date that he has founded the whole system of his
celebrated work.</p>

<p>There are not wanting those, however, who,
admitting that the zodiac has been invented in
Egypt, have imagined allegories applicable to later
times. Thus, according to Mr Hamilton,
the Virgin would represent the land of Egypt
when not yet fecundated by the inundation; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
Lion, the season when that country is most liable
to be overrun by ferocious animals, and so on<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>.</p>

<p>The high antiquity of 15,000 years would besides
induce this absurd consequence, that the
Egyptians, those men who represented every
thing by emblems, and who must have attached
a great importance to the circumstance that these
emblems were conformable to the ideas which
they were intended to represent, had preserved the
signs of the zodiac thousands of years after they
no longer in any way corresponded with their original
signification.</p>

<p>The late M. Remi Raige endeavoured to support
the opinion of Dupuis by an argument of an entirely
new kind<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>. Having remarked that significations
more or less analogous to the figures of
the signs of the zodiac, might be found for the
Egyptian names of the months, on explaining
them by the oriental languages, and finding in
Ptolemy that <em>epifi</em>, which signifies <em>capricorn</em>,
commences at the 20th of June, and therefore
comes immediately after the summer solstice, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
concluded from thence, that, at the beginning, Capricorn
itself was at the summer solstice, and so
of the other signs, as Dupuis had supposed.</p>

<p>But, independently of all that there is merely
conjectural in these etymologies, Raige did not
perceive that it was simply by chance that, five
years after the battle of Actium, in the year 25
before Christ, at the establishment of the fixed
year of Alexandria, the first day of <em>Thoth</em> was
found to correspond with the 29th of the Julian
August, and continued to correspond since that
time. It is only from this epoch that the Egyptian
months commenced at fixed days of the Julian
year, and only at Alexandria: even Ptolemy
did not the less continue to employ in his
Almagest the ancient Egyptian year with its
vague months<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>.</p>

<p>Why might not the names of the signs have
been given to the months at some epoch, or the
names of the months to the signs, in the same arbitrary
manner in which the Indians have given
to their twenty-seven months twelve names, selected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
from among those of their lunar houses, for
reasons which it is impossible at the present day
to determine<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>? The absurdity which there
would have been in preserving for the constellations,
during 15,000 years, figures and symbolical
names which no longer presented any relation
with their position, would have been more evident
had it been carried so far as to preserve to the
months those same names which were incessantly
in the mouths of the people, and whose inaptitude
would be every moment perceived.</p>

<p>And what, besides, would all these systems
come to, had the figures and the names of the
zodiacal constellations been given to them without
any relation to the course of the sun; as
their inequality, the extension of several of them
beyond the zodiac, and their manifest connection
with the neighbouring constellations, seem to demonstrate
was the case<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>.</p>

<p>What would still happen, if, as Macrobius expressly
says<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>, each sign must have been an emblem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
of the sun, considered in some one of its effects
or of its general phenomena, and without
reference to the months when it passes, whether
into the sign, or to its opposite?</p>

<p>Lastly, What if the names had been given in
an abstract manner to the divisions of space or
time, as they are now given by astronomers to
what they call the signs, and had not been applied
to the constellations or groups of stars, but at
a period determined by chance, so that nothing
could be concluded from their signification<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>?</p>

<p>In these suggestions there is, without doubt,
enough to give an ingenuous mind a distaste for
seeking to find in astronomy proofs of the antiquity
of the nations. But were these alleged
proofs as certain as they are vague and destitute
of any satisfactory result, what could be concluded
from them against the great catastrophe, which
has left monuments amply demonstrative in other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
respects of its existence? All that can be admitted
in this matter is, what some moderns have
thought, that astronomy was among the number
of the sciences preserved by those whom this catastrophe
dispersed.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Exaggerations_relative"><em>Exaggerations relative to the Antiquity of certain
Mining Operations.</em></h2>

<p>The antiquity of certain mining operations has
also been much exaggerated. A very late writer
has imagined, that the mines of the island of
Elba, judging from the rubbish carried out of
them, must have been wrought for more than
40,000 years; but another author, who has also
examined this rubbish with attention, has reduced
the period in question to a little more than
5000 years,<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> and this even on the supposition
that the ancients did not extract annually more
than a fourth part of the quantity of ore now
wrought. But what reason could there be to
suppose that the Romans, for example, who consumed
so much iron in their armies, derived so
little advantage from these mines? Moreover, if
these mines had been wrought for even 4000 years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
only, how should iron have been so little known
in the times of remote antiquity?</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="General_Conclusion"><em>General Conclusion relative to the Period of the last
Revolution.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>I agree, therefore, with MM. Deluc and Dolomieu,
in thinking, that if any thing in geology
be established, it is, that the surface of our globe
has undergone a great and sudden revolution,
the date of which cannot be referred to a much
earlier period than five or six thousand years ago;
that this revolution overwhelmed and caused to
disappear the countries which were previously inhabited
by man, and the species of animals now
best known; that, on the other hand, it laid dry
the bottom of the last sea, and formed of it the
countries which are at the present day inhabited;
that it is since the occurrence of this revolution
that the small number of individuals dispersed by
it have spread and propagated over the newly exposed
lands, and, consequently, that it is since
this epoch only, that human societies have assumed
a progressive march, that they have formed
establishments, raised monuments, collected natural
facts, and invented scientific systems.</p>

<p>But the countries which are at present inhabited,
and which the last revolution laid dry, had
already been previously inhabited, if not by men,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
at least by land animals, and, therefore, one preceding
revolution at least had put them under
water; and if we may judge by the different orders
of animals the remains of which are observed
in them, they had perhaps been subjected to two
or three irruptions of the sea.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Further_Researches"><em>Further Researches to be made in Geology.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>These alternations now appear to me to form
the problem in geology that it is of most importance
to solve, or rather to define and circumscribe
within due limits; for, in order to resolve it satisfactorily,
it would be necessary to discover the
cause of these events,&mdash;an undertaking which
presents a difficulty of quite a different kind.</p>

<p>I repeat it, we see pretty clearly what is going
on at the surface of the continents in their present
state; we have formed a tolerable conception
of the uniform progress and regular succession of
the primitive formations, but the study of the secondary
formations has been little more than
merely commenced. That wonderful series of unknown
zoophytes and marine mollusca, succeeded
by reptiles and fresh-water fishes equally unknown;
and these again replaced, in their turn,
by other zoophytes and mollusca, more nearly related
to those of the present day; those land animals,
and those equally unknown fresh water mollusca
and other animals which next occupied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
the surface, to be again displaced but by mollusca
and other animals similar to those of our
present seas; the relations of these diversified beings
to the plants the remains of which accompany
theirs, the connection of these two kingdoms with
the mineral strata in which they are deposited;
the greater or less uniformity existing between
these different orders of beings in the different
basins;&mdash;these are phenomena which appear to
me imperiously to demand the attention of philosophers.</p>

<p>Rendered interesting by the variety of the products
of the partial or general revolutions of this
epoch, and by the abundance of the various species
that figure alternately on the stage, this study is
divested of the dryness of that of the primordial
formations, and does not, like it, almost necessarily
launch into hypotheses. The facts are so
direct, so curious, and so evident, that they are
sufficient, so to speak, to satisfy the most ardent
imagination; and the conclusions to which they
lead from time to time, however scrupulous the
observer may be, having nothing vague in them,
are equally free of any thing arbitrary. In fine,
it is in those events that approach nearer to our
own times, that we may hope to find some traces
of more ancient events, and of their causes; if,
indeed, after so many fruitless attempts as have
been already made, one may be permitted to flatter
himself with such a hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>These ideas have haunted, I may almost say
have tormented me, during my researches among
fossil bones, the results of which I have lately presented
to the public; researches which embrace
but a very small part of those phenomena of the
age preceding the last general revolution of the
globe, and which are yet intimately connected
with all the others. It was almost impossible that
the desire should not arise of investigating the
general mass of these phenomena, at least as they
occur in a limited space around us. My excellent
friend, M. Brongniart, in whose mind other studies
excited the same desire, had the complaisance
to associate me with himself in the task;
and it is thus that we have laid the first foundations
of our labours upon the environs of Paris.
But this work, while it still bears my name, has
become almost entirely that of my friend, from
the infinite attention which he has bestowed, since
the first conception of our plan, and since our
journeys, upon the profound investigation of the
objects, and the perfecting and arranging of the
whole. I have placed it, with M. Brongniart’s
consent, in the second part of my “Recherches,”
in that in which I treat of the fossil bones of our
neighbourhood. Although apparently relating
only to a rather limited extent of country, it affords
numerous results, which are applicable to
geology in general, and, in this point of view, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
may be considered as intimately connected with
the present discourse; at the same time, that it
is, without a doubt, one of the best ornaments of
my work<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>.</p>

<p>In it there is presented the history of the most
recent changes that have taken place in a particular
basin, and it descends so far as the Chalk formation,
the extent of which over the globe is vastly
more considerable than that of the materials of
the basin of Paris. The chalk, which has been
considered so modern, is thus found to be advanced
in antiquity among the ages of the great
period preceding the last catastrophe. It forms
a sort of limit between the most recent formations,
those to which the name of <em>Tertiary</em> may be reserved,
and the formations which are named <em>Secondary</em>,
which have been deposited before the
Chalk, but after the Primitive and Transition
formations.</p>

</div>

<p>The most superficial strata, those deposits of
mud and clayey sand, mixed with rolled pebbles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
that have been transported from distant countries,
and filled with bones of land animals, the species
of which are for the most part unknown, or at
least foreign to the country in which they are
found, seem especially to have covered all the
plains, filled the bottom of all the caverns, and
choked up all the fissures of rocks that have come
in their way. Described with particular care by
Mr Buckland, under the name of <em>diluvium</em>, and
very different from those other beds equally
consisting of transported matters, continually deposited
by torrents and rivers, which contain only
bones of animals that still live in the country,
and distinguished by the name of <em>alluvium</em>, the
former are now considered by all geologists as exhibiting
the most obvious proof of the immense
inundation which has been the last of the catastrophes
of our globe<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>.</p>

<p>Between this diluvium and the chalk, are the
formations alternately filled with fresh water and
salt water productions, which mark the irruptions
and retreatings of the sea, to which this part of
the globe has been subjected, since the deposition
of the chalk-strata: first, marls and buhrstones,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
or cavernous quartz, filled with fresh-water shells,
similar to those of our marshes and pools; under
them marls, sandstones, and limestones, all the
shells of which are marine, such as oysters, &amp;c.</p>

<p>At a greater depth are found fresh water formations
of an older date, and particularly those
famous gypsum deposits of the neighbourhood of
Paris, which have afforded so much facility in ornamenting
the buildings of that great city, and
in which we have discovered whole genera of land-animals,
of which no traces had been elsewhere
perceived.</p>

<p>They rest upon those not less remarkable beds
of limestone, of which our capital is built, in the
more or less compact texture of which the patience
and sagacity of our naturalists, and of several ardent
collectors, have already detected more than
800 species of shells, all of them marine, but the
greater part unknown in the presently-existing
sea. They also contain only bones of fishes, and
of cetacea and other marine mammifera.</p>

<p>Under this marine limestone there is another
fresh water deposit, formed of clay, in which there
are interposed large beds of lignite (brown coal),
or that sort of fossil-coal which is of more recent
origin than the common or black coal. Among
shells, which are always of fresh water origin, there
are also found bones in the deposit; but, what is
remarkable, bones of reptiles, and not of mammi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>fera.
It is filled with crocodiles and tortoises, but
the genera of extinct mammifera which the
gypsum contains, are not found in it: they evidently
did not exist in the country when these
clays and lignites were formed.</p>

<p>This fresh water formation, the oldest which
has been distinguished in our neighbourhood, and
which supports all the formations which we have
just enumerated, is itself supported and embraced
on all sides by the chalk, an immense formation,
both as to thickness and extent, which shews itself
in very distant countries, such as Pomerania
and Poland; but which, in our vicinity, reigns
with a sort of continuity in Berri, Champagne,
Picardy, Upper Normandy, and a part of England,
and thus forms a great circle, or rather
a great basin, in which the deposits of which we
have been speaking are contained, but of which
they also cover the edges in the places where they
were less elevated.</p>

<p>In fact, it is not in our basin only that these
various formations have been deposited. In the
other countries where the surface of the chalk
presented similar cavities for them; in those even
where there was no chalk, and where the older
formations alone presented themselves as supports,
circumstances often led to the formation of deposits
more or less similar to ours, and containing
the same organic bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>Our formations containing fresh-water shells,
have been seen in England, in Spain, and even
so far as the confines of Poland.</p>

<p>The marine shells interposed between them,
have been found along the whole course of the
Appenines.</p>

<p>Some of the quadrupeds of our gypsum deposits,
our palæotheria, for example, have also left
their bones in certain gypseous formations of the
Velai, and in the molasse quarries of the south of
France.</p>

<p>Thus the partial revolutions which have taken
place in our neighbourhood, between the period
of the chalk and that of the great inundation,
and during which the sea threw itself upon our
districts or retired from them, had also taken
place in a multitude of other countries. It seems
as if the globe had undergone a long series of
changes by which variations were produced, probably
in close succession, as the deposits which they
have left nowhere shew much thickness or solidity.
The chalk has been produced by a more
tranquil and more continuous sea; it contains only
marine productions, among which there are, however,
some very remarkable vertebrate animals,
but all of the class of reptiles and fishes; large
tortoises, vast lizards, and other similar animals.</p>

<p>The formations anterior to the chalk, and in
the hollows of which the chalk is itself deposited,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
as the formations of our neighbourhood are in its
hollows, form a great part of Germany and England;
and the efforts which the naturalists of these
two countries have recently made according with
ours, and proceeding upon the same principles, combined
with those which had been previously tried
by the school of Werner, will soon leave nothing
to be desired with respect to our knowledge of
them. Messrs de Humboldt and de Bonnard in
France and Germany, and Messrs Buckland and
Conybeare in England, have furnished the most
complete and most instructive accounts of them.</p>

<p>Under the chalk are found deposits of green
sand, of which its lower strata contains some organic
remains. Beneath this are ferruginous sands.
In many countries both of these deposits are agglutinated
into beds of sandstone, in which lignites,
amber, and remains of reptiles, are also observed.</p>

<p>Under this, we find the great mass of strata
which compose the Jura chain, and that of the
mountains by which it is continued into Suabia
and Franconia, the principal ridges of the Apennines,
and multitudes of beds in France and
England. It consists of limestone-schists, rich
in fishes and crustacea; vast beds of oolites, or
of a granular limestone; grey marly limestones,
with pyrites, characterised by the presence of ammonites,
of oysters with recurvate valves, named
Gryphææ, and of reptiles, which are remarkable
on account of their forms and structures.</p>

<p>Large beds of sand and sandstone, often presenting
vegetable impressions, support all these
Jura deposits, and are themselves supported by a
limestone, the innumerable shells and zoophytes
contained in which induced Werner to give it
the much too general name of <em>Shell-limestone</em>,
and which is separated by other beds of sandstone,
of the kind denominated <em>variegated</em> sandstone,
from a still older limestone, which has been not
less improperly called <em>Alpine limestone</em>, because
it composes the High Alps of the Tyrol; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
which also shews itself at the surface in the eastern
provinces of France, and in the whole southern
part of Germany.</p>

<p>In this shell-limestone are deposited great
masses of gypsum and rich beds of salt; and under
it are found the thin beds of copper-slates so
rich in fishes, among which there are also fresh-water
reptiles. The copper-slate rests upon a
red sandstone, to the epoch of which belong those
famous deposits of coal, which supply the present
inhabitants of the civilized countries of Europe
with fuel, and are the remains of the first vegetable
productions with which the face of the globe
was adorned. We learn from the trunks of
ferns, whose impressions they have preserved,
how different these ancient forests have been
from ours.</p>

<p>We then quickly come to those transition formations,
in which primeval nature, nature dead
and purely mineral, seems to have disputed the
empire with organising nature. Black limestones,
and schists which present only crustacea and shells
of kinds now extinct, alternate with remains of
primitive formations, and announce our having
arrived at those formations, the oldest with which
we are acquainted, those ancient foundations of
the present envelop of the globe, the marbles and
primitive slates, the gneisses, and, lastly, the granites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>Such is the precise enumeration of the successive
masses with which nature has enveloped the
globe. The positive geological information presented
by it, has been obtained, by combining the
knowledge furnished by mineralogy with that
presented by the sciences connected with organic
existence. This order, so new and so interesting
in facts, has only been acquired by geology, since
it preferred positive knowledge, furnished by observation,
to fanciful systems, contradictory conjectures
regarding the first origin of the globe, and all
those phenomena, which, having no resemblance
to what actually takes place in nature, could neither
find in it, for their explanation, materials
nor touchstone. A few years ago, the greater
number of geologists might have been compared
to historians, who, in writing the history of France,
should have interested themselves only about the
events which had taken place among the Gauls before
the time of Julius Cesar. In composing their
romances, however, these historians would have
taken advantage of their knowledge of posterior
facts; and the geologists of whom I speak, absolutely
neglected the posterior facts, which could
alone have reflected some light upon the darkness
of preceding times.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Enumeration_of_the_Fossil_Animals"><em>Enumeration of the Fossil Animals recognised by the
Author.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>In concluding this discourse, there only remains
for me now to present the result of my own researches,
or, in other words, a general account of
my great work. I shall enumerate the animals
which I have discovered, in the inverse order of
that which I have followed in my enumeration of
the formations. By proceeding deeper and deeper
into the series of strata, I there rose in the series
of epochs. I shall now take the oldest formations,&mdash;make
known the animals which they contain,&mdash;and,
passing from one epoch to another, point out
those which successively make their appearance
in proportion as we approach the present time.</p>

<p>We have seen that zoophytes, mollusca, and
certain crustacea, begin to appear in the Transition
formations; perhaps there may even at that period
be bones and skeletons of fishes; but we do
not by any means observe at so early a period remains
of animals which live on land, and respire
air in its ordinary state.</p>

<p>The great beds of coal, and the trunks of palms
and ferns of which they preserve the impressions,
although they afford evidence of the existence of
dry land, and of a vegetation no longer confined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
to the waters, do not yet shew bones of quadrupeds,
not even of oviparous quadrupeds.</p>

<p>It is only a little above this, in the bituminous
copper-slates, that we see the first traces of them;
and, what is very remarkable, the first quadrupeds
are reptiles of the family of lizards, very much
resembling the large monitors which live at the
present day in the torrid zone. Several individuals
of this kind have been found in the mines
of Thuringia<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>, among innumerable fishes of a
genus now unknown, but which, from its relations
to the genera of our days, appears to have lived in
fresh water. Every body knows that the monitors
are also fresh water animals.</p>

<p>A little higher is the limestone called Alpine,
and resting upon it the shell-limestone, so rich in
entrochites and encrinites, which forms the basis
of a great part of Germany and Lorraine.</p>

<p>In it have been found skeletons of a very large
sea-tortoise, the shells of which might have been
from six to eight feet in length; and those of another
oviparous quadruped of the family of lizards,
of a large size, and with a very sharp muzzle<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>.</p>

<p>Rising still through sandstones, which present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
only vegetable impressions of large arundinaceæ,
bamboos, palms, and other monocotyledonous
plants, we come to the different strata of the deposit
which has been named the Jura limestone,
on account of its forming the principal nucleus of
that chain of mountains.</p>

<p>It is here that the class of Reptiles assumes its
full development, and shews itself under the most
varied forms and gigantic sizes.</p>

<p>The middle part, which is composed of oolites
and lias, or of grey sandstone containing gryphites,
contains the remains of two genera, the most extraordinary
of all, which have combined the characters
of the class of oviparous quadrupeds with
organs of motion similar to those of the cetacea.</p>

<p>The <em>ichthyosaurus</em><a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>, discovered by Sir Everard
Home, has the head of a lizard, but prolonged
into an attenuated muzzle, armed with conical
and pointed teeth; enormous eyes, the sclerotica
of which is strengthened by a frame consisting of
bony pieces; a spine composed of flat vertebræ, of
a depressed circular form, and concave on both
surfaces like those of fishes; slender ribs; a sternum
and clavicles like those of lizards and ornithorynchi;
a small and weak pelvis; and four
limbs, of which the humeri and femurs are short<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
and thick, while the other bones are flattened,
and closely set like the stones in a pavement, so
as to form, when enveloped with the skin, fins of
a single piece, almost incapable of bending; analogous,
in short, both as to use and organization,
to those of cetacea. These reptiles have lived in
the sea; on shore, they could only at most have
crept in the hobbling manner of seals; at the same
time after they have respired elastic air.</p>

<p>The remains of four species have been found:</p>

<p>The most extensively distributed (<em>I. communis</em>)
has blunt conical teeth; its length sometimes
exceeds twenty feet.</p>

<p>The second (<em>I. platyodon</em>), which is at least as
large as the former, has compressed teeth, with
round and bulging roots.</p>

<p>The third (<em>I. tenuirostris</em>), has slender and
pointed teeth, and the muzzle thin and elongated.</p>

<p>The fourth (<em>I. intermedius</em>), is, as its name
implies, intermediate between the last species and
the common, with respect to the form of its teeth.
The two latter species do not attain half the size
of the two first.</p>

<p>The <em>plesiosaurus</em>, discovered by Mr Conybeare,
must have appeared still more monstrous
than the ichthyosaurus. It had the same limbs,
but somewhat more elongated and more flexible;
its shoulder and pelvis were more robust; its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
vertebræ had more of the forms and articulations
of the lizards; but what distinguished it from all
oviparous and viviparous quadrupeds, was a slender
neck as long as its body, composed of thirty
and odd vertebræ, a number greater than that
of the neck of any other animal, rising from the
trunk like the body of a serpent, and terminating
in a very small head, in which all the essential
characters of that of the lizard family are observed.</p>

<p>If any thing could justify those hydras and
other monsters, the figures of which are so often
presented in the monuments of the middle ages,
it would incontestibly be this plesiosaurus.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>Five species are already known, of which the
most generally distributed (<em>P. dolichodeirus</em>) attains
a length of more than twenty feet.</p>

<p>A second species (<em>P. recentior</em>), found in more
modern strata, has the vertebræ flatter.</p>

<p>A third (<em>P. carinatus</em>) shews a ridge on the
under surface of its vertebræ.</p>

<p>A fourth, and lastly a fifth (<em>P. pentagonus</em>
and <em>P. trigonus</em>), have the ribs marked with five
and three ridges.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>These two genera are found everywhere in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
lias: they were discovered in England, where
this rock is exposed in cliffs of great extent; but
they have also been found since in France and
Germany.</p>

<p>Along with these had lived two species of Crocodiles,
the bones of which are also found deposited
in the lias, among ammonites, terebratulæ,
and other shells of that ancient sea. We have
skeletons of them in our cliffs at Honfleur, where
the remains are found, from which I have drawn
up their characters.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>One of these species, the <em>Long-beaked Gavial</em>,
has the muzzle longer, and the head more narrow,
than the gavial or long-beaked crocodile of the
Ganges; the bodies of its vertebræ are convex
before, while in our crocodiles of the present day
they are so behind. It has been found in the
lias deposits of Franconia, as well as in those of
France.</p>

<p>A second species, the <em>Short-beaked Gavial</em>,
has the muzzle of ordinary length, less attenuated
than the gavial of the Ganges, but more so than
our crocodiles of St Domingo. Its vertebræ are
slightly concave at each of their extremities.</p>

<p>But these crocodiles are not the only ones
which have been deposited in the strata of these
secondary limestones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<p>The beautiful oolite quarries of Caen have
presented a very remarkable one, the muzzle of
which is as long and more pointed than that of
the long-beaked gavial, and its head more dilated
behind, with wider temporal fossæ. Its stony
scales, marked with small round cavities, must
have rendered it the best defended of all the crocodiles.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
Its lower teeth are alternately longer and
shorter.</p>

<p>There is still another in the oolite of England;
but there have only been found some portions of
its cranium, which do not suffice to afford a complete
idea of it.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>Another very remarkable genus of reptiles, the
remains of which, although they are also found
beyond the limits of the lias concretion, are especially
abundant in the oolite and upper sands, is
the <em>megalosaurus</em>, justly so named, for, along
with the forms of the lizards, and particularly of
the monitors, of which it has also the sharp-edged
and dentated teeth, it presents so enormous
a size, that if we suppose it to have possessed the
proportions of the monitors, it must have exceeded
seventy feet in length. It was, in fact, a lizard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
of the size of a whale.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> It was discovered by
Mr Buckland in England; but we have it also
in France; and in Germany there are found bones,
if not of the same species, at least of a species
which can be referred to no other genus. It is
to M. Sœmmering that we owe the first description
of this last. He discovered the bones in strata
lying above the oolite, in those limestone-schists of
Franconia, long celebrated for the numerous fossil
remains which they furnished to the cabinets
of the curious, and which will be still more celebrated
for the services which their employment in
lithography render to the arts and sciences.</p>

<p>The crocodiles continue to make their appearance
in these schists, and always of the long-muzzled
or rostrated kind. M. de Sœmmering has
described one (the <em>Crocodilus priscus</em>), the entire
skeleton of a small individual of which was found
nearly in as good a state of preservation, as it
could have been in our cabinets.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> It is one of
those which most resemble the present gavial of
the Ganges; the anterior or united part of its lower
jaw, however, is less elongated; its lower teeth
are alternately and regularly longer and shorter.
It has ten vertebræ in the tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<p>But the most remarkable animals which these
limestone slates contain, are the flying lizards,
which I have named <em>Pterodactyli</em>.</p>

<p>They are reptiles whose principal characters
are, a very short tail, a very long neck, the muzzle
much elongated, and armed with sharp teeth; the
legs also long, and one of the toes of the anterior
extremity excessively elongated, having probably
served for the attachment of a membrane adapted
for supporting them in the air, accompanied with
four other toes of ordinary size, terminated by
hooked claws. One of these strange animals,
whose appearance would be frightful did they occur
alive at the present day, may have been of
the size of a thrush<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>, the other of that of a common
bat<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>; but it would appear from some fragments
that larger species had existed<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>.</p>

<p>A little above the limestone slates is found
the nearly homogeneous limestone of the Jura
ridges. It also contains bones, but always of
reptiles, crocodiles, and fresh-water tortoises, of
which a vast quantity is found in particular
in the neighbourhood of Soleure. They have
been very carefully searched for by M. Hugi;
and, from the fragments which he has already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
collected, it is easy to recognise a considerable
number of Fresh-water Tortoises, or Emydes,
which further discoveries can alone determine,
but of which several are already distinguished by
their size and peculiar forms, from all the species
hitherto known<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>.</p>

<p>It is among these innumerable oviparous
quadrupeds, of all sizes and forms; in the midst
of these crocodiles, tortoises, flying reptiles, huge
megalosauri, and monstrous plesiosauri, that some
small Mammifera are said to make their appearance
for the first time; and the assertion is so
far authenticated by the occurrence of jaws,
and some other bones discovered in England,
which undoubtedly belong to this class of animals,
and particularly to the family of Didelphides,
or to that of the Insectivora.</p>

<p>It may, however, be supposed, that the stoney
matters which encrust these bones, owe their origin
to some local recomposition, posterior to the original
formation of the strata. However this may
be, it is still found for a long time that the class of
Reptiles predominates.</p>

<p>The ferruginous sands, placed in England
above the chalk, contain abundance of crocodiles,
tortoises, megalosauri, and especially a reptile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
which presents a character quite peculiar, in as
much as its teeth appear worn, like those of our
herbivorous mammifera.</p>

<p>To Mr Mantell of Lewes, in Sussex, we are
indebted for the discovery of this latter animal,
as well as of other large reptiles belonging to
the sands lying beneath the chalk. He has
<ins class="corr" id="tn-263" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'named it Iquanodron'">
named it <em>Iguanodon</em></ins><ins class="corr" id="tn-263a" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash; missing anchor inserted here">
<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>.</ins></p>

<p>In the chalk itself there are only reptiles to be
seen: there are found in it remains of tortoises
and crocodiles. The famous tufaceous quarries
of the mountain of St Peter, near Maestricht,
which belong to the chalk formation, along with
very large sea tortoises, and a multitude of marine
shells and zoophytes, have afforded a genus
of lizards not less gigantic than the megalosaurus,
which has become celebrated by the researches
of Camper, and the figures which Faujas
has given of its bones, in his history of that
mountain.</p>

<p>It was upwards of five and twenty feet long;
its large jaws were armed with very strong conical
teeth, a little arcuate, and marked with a
ridge, and it had also some of these teeth in the
palate. Upwards of a hundred and thirty vertebræ
were counted in its spine; they were convex<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
before, and concave behind. Its tail was deep
and flat, and formed a large vertical oar (or organ
of swimming).<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Mr Conybeare has recently
proposed to name it <em>Mosasaurus</em>.</p>

<p>The clays and lignites which cover the upper
part of the chalk, I have only found to contain
crocodiles<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>; and I have every reason to think
that the lignites which in Switzerland have afforded
beaver and mastodon bones, belong to a
later epoch. Nor has it been at an earlier period
than that of the coarse limestone which rests upon
these clays that I have begun to find bones of
mammifera; and still do they all belong to marine
mammifera, to dolphins of unknown species,
lamantins and morses.</p>

<p>Among the dolphins, there is one, the muzzle
of which, more elongated than that of any known
species, has the lower jaw united in a considerable
part of its length, nearly as in a gavial. It
was found near Dax by the late president of
Borda<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>.</p>

<p>Another species, from the cliffs of the Department
de l’Orne, has the muzzle also long, but
somewhat differently shaped<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>.</p>

<p>The entire genus of lamantins is at the present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
day confined to the seas of the torrid zone; and that
of the morses, of which only a single living species
is known to exist, is limited to the frozen ocean.
Yet we find skeletons of these two genera side by
side in the coarse limestone strata of the middle
of France; and this association of species, the
nearest allied to which are, at the present day,
found in opposite zones, will again make its appearance
more than once as we proceed.</p>

<p>Our fossil lamantins differ from those known to
exist at present, in having the head more elongated,
and of a different form<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>. Their ribs, which
are easily recognised by their being of a thick and
rounded form, and of dense texture, are not of rare
occurrence in our different provinces.</p>

<p>With regard to the fossil morse, small fragments
only have as yet been found of it, which
are insufficient for characterising the species<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>.</p>

<p>It is only in the strata that have succeeded the
coarse limestone, or, at most, those which may
have been of contemporaneous formation with it,
but deposited in fresh-water lakes, that the class
of land mammifera begins to shew itself in any
quantity.</p>

<p>I consider as belonging to the same period, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
as having lived together, but perhaps in different
spots, the animals whose bones are deposited in
the molasse and old gravel beds of the south of
France; in the gypsums mixed with limestone,
such as those of Paris and Aix; and in the fresh-water
marly deposits covered with marine beds, of
Alsace, the country of Orleans and of Berry.</p>

<p>This animal population possesses a very remarkable
character in the abundance and variety of
certain genera of pachydermata, which are entirely
awanting among the quadrupeds of our days, and
whose characters have more or less resemblance
to those of the tapirs, the rhinoceroses, and camels.</p>

<p>These genera, the entire discovery of which is
my own, are the <em>palæotheria</em>, <em>lophiodonta</em>, <em>anaplotheria</em>,
<em>anthracotheria</em>, <em>cheropotami</em>, and <em>adapis</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Palæotheria</em> have resembled the tapirs in
their general form, and in that of the head, particularly
in the shortness of the bones of the nose,
which announces that they have had a small proboscis
like the tapirs, and, lastly, in their having
six incisors and two canine teeth in each jaw; but
they have resembled the rhinoceros in their grinders,
of which those of the upper jaw have been
square, with prominent ridges of various configuration,
and those of the lower jaw in the form of double
crescents, as well as in their feet, all of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
have been divided into three toes, while in the
tapirs the fore feet have four.</p>

<p>It is one of the most extensively diffused genera
and most numerous in species that occur in
the deposits of this period.</p>

<p>Our gypsum quarries in the neighbourhood of
Paris are full of them. Bones of seven distinct
species are found there. The first (<em>P. magnum</em>)
is as large as a horse. The three next are of the
size of a hog, but one of them (<em>P. medium</em>) has
narrow and long feet, another (<em>P. crassum</em>) has
the feet broader, and a third (<em>P. latum</em>) has them
still broader, and especially shorter. The fifth
species (<em>P. curtum</em>), which is of the size of a
sheep, is much lower, and has the feet still broader
and shorter in proportion than the last. The
sixth (<em>P. minus</em>) is of the size of a small sheep,
and has long and slender feet, the lateral toes of
which are shorter than the rest. The seventh
(<em>P. minimum</em>), which is not larger than a hare,
has also the feet slender<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>.</p>

<p>Palæotheria have also been found in other districts
of France: at Puy in Valey, in strata of
gypseous marl, a species (<em>P. velaunum</em>)<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>, much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
resembling (<em>P. medium</em>), but differing from it in
the form of its lower jaw; in the neighbourhood
of Orleans, in strata of marly rock, a species (<em>P.
aurelianense</em>)<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>, which is distinguished from the
others by having the re-entering angle of the crescent
of its lower grinders split into a double point,
and by some differences in the necks of the upper
grinders; near Issel, in a bed of gravel or molasse,
along the declivities of the Black Mountain, a
species (<em>P. isselanum</em>)<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>, which has the same characters
as the Orleans species, but is of smaller
size. It is more particularly, however, in the
molasse of the Department of the Dordogne,
that the palæotherium occurs not less abundantly
than in our gypsum deposits in the neighbourhood
of Paris.</p>

<p>The Duke Decaze has discovered in the quarries
of a single field, bones of three species which
appear different from all those of our neighbourhood<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Lophiodons</em> approach still somewhat nearer
to the tapirs than the palæotheria do, inasmuch
as their lower false grinders have transverse
necks like those of the tapirs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<p>They differ, however, from these latter, in having
the fore ones more simple, the backmost of all
with three necks, and the upper ones rhomboidal,
and marked with ridges very much resembling
those of the rhinoceros.</p>

<p>We are still ignorant what the form of their
snout, and the number of their toes, may have been.
I have discovered not less than twelve species of
this genus, all in France, deposited in marly rocks
of fresh-water formation, and filled with lymneæ
and planorbes, which are shells peculiar to pools
and marshes.</p>

<p>The largest species is found near Orleans, in
the same quarry as the palæotheria; it approaches
the rhinoceros.</p>

<p>There is a smaller species in the same place; a
third occurs at Montpellier; a fourth near Laon;
two near Buchsweiler in Alsace; five near Argenton
in Berry; and one of the three occurs
again near Issel, where there are also two others.
There is also a large one near Gannat<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>.</p>

<p>These species differ from each other in size, the
smallest being scarcely so large as a lamb of three
months, and in various circumstances connected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
with the form of their teeth, which it would be
too tedious and minute to detail here.</p>

<p>The <em>Anoplotheria</em> have hitherto been discovered
nowhere but in the gypsum quarries of the
neighbourhood of Paris. They have two characters
which are observed in no other animal; feet with
two toes, the metacarpal and metatarsal bones of
which are separate in their whole length, and do
not unite into a single piece, as in the ruminantia;
and teeth placed in a continuous series without
any interruption. Man alone has the teeth
so placed in mutual contiguity, without any interval.
Those of the anaplotheria consist of six incisors
in each jaw, a canine tooth and six grinders
on each side, both above and below; their canine
teeth are short and similar to the outer incisors.
The three first grinders are compressed; the four
others are, in the upper jaw, square, with transverse
ridges, and a small cone between them; and,
in the lower jaw, in the form of a double crescent,
but without neck at the base. The last has three
crescents. Their head is of an oblong form, and
does not indicate that the muzzle has terminated
either in a proboscis or a snout.</p>

<p>This extraordinary genus, which can be compared
to nothing in living nature, is subdivided
into three subgenera: the <em>Anaplotheria</em>, properly
so called, the anterior molares of which are still
pretty thick, and the posterior ones of the lower<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
jaw have their crescents with a simple ridge; the
<em>Xiphodons</em>, of which the anterior molares are
thin and sharp on the edges, and the under posterior,
have, directly opposite the concavity of each
of their crescents, a point, which, on being worn,
also assumes the form of a crescent, so that then
the crescents are double as in the ruminantia;
lastly, the <em>Dichobunes</em>, the outer crescents of
which are also pointed at the beginning, and
which have thus points disposed in pairs upon
their lower posterior grinders.</p>

<p>The most common species in our gypsum quarries
(<em>An. commune</em>), is an animal of the height
of a boar, but much more elongated, and furnished
with a very long and very thick tail, so that altogether
it has nearly the proportion of the otter,
but larger. It is probable that it was well fitted
for swimming, and frequented the lakes in the
bottom of which its bones have been incrusted by
the gypsum which was deposited there. We have
one a little smaller, but in other respects pretty
similar (<em>An. secundarium</em>.)</p>

<p>We are as yet acquainted with only one <em>xiphodon</em>,
which, however, is a very remarkable animal:
it is that which I have named <em>An. gracile</em>.
It is slender, and delicately formed, like the prettiest
gazelle.</p>

<p>There is one <em>dichobune</em>, nearly of the size of a
hare, to which I have given the name of <em>An. leporinum</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
Besides its subgeneric characters, it
differs from the anaplotheria and xiphodons, in
having two small and slender toes on each foot,
at the sides of the two large toes.</p>

<p>We do not know if these lateral toes exist in
the two other dichobunes, which are small, and
scarcely exceed in size the common Guinea pig<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>.</p>

<p>The genus of <em>Anthracotheria</em> is in some degree
intermediate between the palæotheria, anaplotheria,
and hogs. I have named it so, because
two of its species have been found in the lignites
of Cadibona, near Savone. The first approached
the rhinoceros in size; the second was much
smaller. They have also been found in Alsace,
and in the Vélay. Their grinders are similar to
those of the anaplotheria; but they have projecting
canine teeth<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>.</p>

<p>The genus <em>Cheropotamus</em> is found in our gypsum
deposits, where it accompanies the palæotheria
and anaplotheria, but where it is of much
rarer occurrence. Its posterior grinders are square
above, rectangular below, and have four large
conical eminences surrounded with smaller ones.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
The anterior molares are short cones, slightly
compressed, and with two roots. Its canine teeth
are small. Neither its incisors nor its feet are yet
known. I possess only one species, which is of
the size of a Siam hog<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>.</p>

<p>The genus <em>Adapis</em> has also but one species,
which is at most of the size of a rabbit: it is also
from our gypsum quarries, and must have been
nearly allied to the anaplotheria<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>.</p>

<p>We have thus nearly forty species of pachydermata
belonging to genera now entirely extinct,
and presenting forms and proportions to which
there is nothing that can be compared in the present
animal kingdom, excepting two tapirs and a
daman.</p>

<p>This large number of pachydermata is so much
the more remarkable, that the ruminantia, which
are at present so numerous in the genera of deer
and antelopes, and which attain so great a size in
those of the oxen, giraffes, and camels, scarcely
make their appearance in the deposits of which
we are speaking.</p>

<p>I have not seen the slightest trace of them in
our gypsum quarries; and all that has come to
my hands consists of some fragments of a deer, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
the size of the roe, but of a different species, collected
among the palæotheria of Orleans<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>; and
of one or two other small fragments, from Switzerland,
which, however, are perhaps of doubtful
origin.</p>

<p>But our pachydermata have not for all this
been the only inhabitants of the countries in
which they lived. In our gypsum deposits, at
least, we find along with them carnivora, glires,
several sorts of birds, crocodiles, and tortoises;
and these two latter genera also accompany them
in the molasse sandstones and marly deposits of
the middle and south of France.</p>

<p>At the head of the carnivora, I place a Bat,
very recently discovered at Montmartre, and which
belongs to the proper genus Vespertilio<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>. The
existence of this genus, at an epoch so remote, is
so much the more surprising, that, neither in this
formation, nor in those which have succeeded it,
have I seen any other trace, either of cheiroptera
or of quadrumana: no bone or tooth of either
monkey or maki has ever presented itself to me,
in the course of my long researches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span></p>

<p>Montmartre has also furnished the bones of a
fox different from ours, and which also differs
from the jackals, isatises, and the various species
of foxes peculiar to America<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>; those of a carnivorous
animal allied to the raccoons and coaties,
but larger than any known species<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>; those of a
particular species of civet<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>; and of two or three
other carnivora, which it has not been possible to
determine, from the want of tolerably complete
portions.</p>

<p>What is still more remarkable, is, that there
are skeletons of a small sarigue, allied to the
marmose, but different, and consequently of an
animal belonging to a genus which is at the present
day confined to the New World<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>. Skeletons
of two small glires, of the genus myoxus<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>,
and a skull belonging to the genus sciurus<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>, have
also been collected.</p>

<p>Our gypsum deposits are more fertile in bones
of birds than any of the other strata either anterior
or posterior to it. Entire skeletons, and parts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
of at least ten species belonging to all the orders,
are found there<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>.</p>

<p>The crocodiles of the period in question approach
our common crocodiles in the form of the
head, while, in the deposits of the Jura period,
we find only species allied to the gavial.</p>

<p>A species has been found at Argenton, which
is remarkable for its compressed, sharp teeth, having
their edges dentated like those of certain
monitors<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>. Some remains of it also occur in our
gypsum quarries<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>.</p>

<p>The tortoises of this period are all fresh-water
ones: some of them belong to the subgenus
<em>Emys</em>; and there are species, both at Montmartre<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>,
and still more especially in the molasse
sandstones of the Dordogne<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>, which are larger
than any living species known; the others are
Trionyces or soft tortoises<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>. This genus, which
is easily distinguished by the vermiculate surface
of the bones of its shell, and which at present
exists only in the rivers of warm countries, such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
as the Nile, the Ganges, and the Orinoko, has
been very abundant in the places where the palæotheria
lived. Vast quantities of its remains are
found at Montmartre<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>, and in the molasse sandstones
of the Dordogne, and the other gravel deposits
of the south of France.</p>

<p>The fresh-water lakes, around which these various
animals have lived, and which had received
their bones, nourished, besides the tortoises and
crocodiles, some fishes and testaceous mollusca.
All that have been collected of these two classes
of animals, are as foreign to our climate, and even
as much unknown in our present waters, as the
palæotheria, and other quadrupeds which were
coeval with them<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>.</p>

<p>The fishes have even in part belonged to unknown
genera.</p>

<p>Hence, it cannot be doubted that this race of
inhabitants, which might be termed the population
of the middle age, this first great production
of mammifera, has been entirely destroyed; and,
in fact, in all places where remains of them have
been discovered, there are great deposits of marine
formation above them, so that the sea has overwhelmed
the countries which these races inhabit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>ed,
and has rested upon them during a long
period of time.</p>

<p>Have the countries inundated by it at this period
been of great extent? This is a question
which the examination of those ancient deposits
formed in their lakes do not enable us to answer.</p>

<p>To this period I refer the gypsum beds of Paris
and those of Aix, several quarries of marly
stones, and the molasse sandstones, at least those
of the south of France. I am of opinion that we
should also refer to it the portions of the molasse
sandstones of Switzerland, and of the lignites of
Liguria and Alsace, in which quadrupeds are
found of the families enumerated above; but I do
not find that any of these animals have been also
found in other countries. The fossil bones of
Germany, England, and Italy, are all either older
or newer than those of which we have been speaking,
and belong either to those ancient races of
reptiles of the juraic and copper-slate formations,
or to the deposits of the last universal inundation,
the diluvial formations.</p>

<p>We are, therefore, authorised to believe, until
the contrary be proved, that at the period when
these numerous pachydermata lived, the globe
had only presented for their habitation a small
number of plains sufficiently fertile for them to
multiply there, and that perhaps these plains were
insulated regions, separated by pretty large spaces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
of elevated chains, in which we do not find
that our animals have left any traces of their existence.</p>

<p>The researches of M. Adolphe Brongniart have
also made known to us the nature of the vegetables
which covered those countries. In the
same strata with our palæotheria, there have been
found trunks of palms, and many others of those
beautiful plants whose genera now only grow in
warm climates. Palms, crocodiles, and trionyces
always occur in greater or less abundance <ins class="corr" id="tn-279" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'whereever our ancient'">
wherever our ancient</ins> pachydermata are found<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>.</p>

<p>The sea which had covered these lands and
destroyed their animals, left large deposits, which
still form at the present day, at no great depth,
the basis of our great plains: it had then retired
anew, and left immense surfaces to a new population,
whose remains are found in the sandy and
muddy deposits of all countries known.</p>

<p>It is to this deposition from the sea, made in a
state of quiet, that certain fossil cetacea, very
much resembling those of our own days, should,
in my opinion, be referred;&mdash;a dolphin, allied to
our epaulard<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>, and a whale very like our rorquals<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>,
both discovered in Lombardy by M. Cortesi;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
a large head of a whale found within the
very precincts of Paris<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>, and described by Lamanon
and Daubenton; and an entirely new genus,
which I have discovered and named <em>Ziphius</em>, and
which already contains three species. It is allied
to the cachalots and hyperoodons<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>.</p>

<p>In the extinct population which fills our alluvial
and superficial strata, and which has lived
upon the deposit just alluded to, there are no
longer either palæotheria <ins class="corr" id="tn-280" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'or anaplothæria'">
or anaplotheria</ins>, or, in
in fact, any of those singular genera. The pachydermata,
however, still predominate; and these
are of a gigantic size, elephants, rhinoceroses,
and hippopotami, accompanied with innumerable
horses and several large ruminantia. Carnivorous
animals of the size of the lion, tiger, and hyena,
had desolated this new animal kingdom. In general,
its character, even in the extreme north,
and on the edges of the present frozen ocean, was
similar to that which the torrid zone alone now
presents, and yet there was no species in it absolutely
the same as any of those which are found
alive at the present day.</p>

<p>The most remarkable of these animals is the
species of elephant named <em>mammoth</em> by the Russians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
(the <em>Elephas primigenius</em> of Blumenbach),
which was fifteen or eighteen feet high, and was
covered with coarse red wool, and long, stiff, black
hairs, which formed a mane along its back. Its
enormous tusks were implanted in alveolæ longer
than those of the elephants of the present day;
but in other respects it was pretty similar to the
Indian elephant<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>. It has left thousands of its
carcases from Spain to the shores of Siberia, and
it has been found in the whole of North America;
so that it had been distributed on both sides
of the Atlantic, if, indeed, that ocean had existed
in its time, in the place which it occupies at present.
It is well known that its tusks are still so
well preserved in cold countries, as to be applied
to the same uses as fresh ivory; and, as we have
already remarked, individuals of it have been
found with their flesh, skin, and hair, which had
remained frozen since the last general catastrophe.
The Tartars and Chinese have imagined it to be
an animal which lives under ground, and perishes
whenever it perceives the light.</p>

<p>After the mammoth, and almost its equal in
size, came also in the countries which form the
two presently existing continents, the <em>narrow
toothed mastodon</em>, which resembled the elephant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
and was armed like it with enormous tusks, but
with tusks covered with enamel, shorter legs,
and whose mamillated grinders, invested with a
thick and shining enamel, have long furnished
what has been called occidental turquoise<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>.</p>

<p>Its remains, which are pretty common in the
temperate parts of Europe, are not so much so
towards the north; but it has also been found in
the mountains of South America, along with two
allied species.</p>

<p>In North America immense quantities of the
remains of the <em>great mastodon</em> have been found,
a species larger than the preceding, as high in
proportion as the elephant, with equally huge
tusks, and whose grinders, which are covered over
with bristling points, made it long be considered
as a carnivorous animal<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>.</p>

<p>Its bones were of a large size, and very solid.
Even its hoofs and stomach are said to have been
found in a sufficient state of preservation to be recognisable;
and it is asserted that the stomach
was filled with bruised branches of trees. The
Indians imagine that the whole race was destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
by the gods, to prevent them from destroying the
human species.</p>

<p>Along with these enormous pachydermata, lived
the two somewhat inferior genera of the rhinoceroses
and hippopotami.</p>

<p>The Hippopotamus of this period was pretty
common in the countries which now form France,
Germany and England, and was particularly so
in Italy. It so closely resembled the present African
species, that it is only by an attentive comparison
that it can be distinguished from it<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>.</p>

<p>There was also at this time a small species of
hippopotamus of the size of the wild boar, to
which there is nothing similar at present existing.</p>

<p>There were at least three species of Rhinoceros
of large size, all of them two-horned.</p>

<p>The most common species in Germany and
England (my <em>Rh. tichorhinus</em>), and which, like
the elephant, is found even to the shores of the
frozen sea, where it has also left entire individuals,
had the head elongated, the bones of the nose
very robust and supported by an osseous and not
merely cartilaginous septum narium, and, lastly,
wanted incisors<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p>Another species, of rarer occurrence, and peculiar
to more temperate climates (<em>Rh. incisivus</em>)<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>,
had incisors like our present rhinoceroses of the
East Indies, and, in particular, resembled that of
Sumatra<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>; its distinctive characters are derived
from some differences in the form of the head.</p>

<p>The third species (<em>Rh. leptorhinus</em>) had no
incisors, like the first and like the present rhinoceros
of the Cape; but it was distinguished by
a more pointed muzzle and more slender limbs<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>.
The bones of this species have been found more
especially in Italy, in the same strata with those
of elephants, mastodons, and hippopotami.</p>

<p>There is a fourth species still (<em>Rh. minutus</em>),
furnished, like the second, with incisors, but of a
much smaller size, and scarcely larger than a
hog<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>. It was undoubtedly rare, for the remains
of it have only as yet been found in some places
in France.</p>

<p>To those four genera of large pachydermata, is
added a Tapir, which equalled them in size, and
was consequently twice, perhaps three times, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
large in its linear dimensions as the American
Tapir<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>. Its teeth have been found in several
parts of France and Germany; and almost always
accompanying those of rhinoceroses, mastodons,
or elephants.</p>

<p>Along with these there is still associated, but as
it would seem in a very small number of places, a
large pachydermatous animal, of which the lower
jaw alone has been found, and whose teeth are of
the form of double crescents, and undulated. M.
Fischer, who discovered it among bones from Siberia,
has named it <em>Elasmotherium</em><a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>.</p>

<p>The Horse genus also existed in those times<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>.
Its teeth accompany in thousands the remains of
the animals which we have just mentioned, in almost
all their localities; but it is not possible to
say whether it was one of the species now existing
or not, because the skeletons of these species
are so like each other, that they cannot be distinguished
by the mere comparison of isolated fragments.</p>

<p>The Ruminantia were now greatly more numerous
than at the epoch of the Palæotheria; their
numerical proportion must even have differed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
very little from what it is at present; but we are
certain of several species which were different.</p>

<p>This may, in particular, be said with much
certainty of a deer exceeding even the elk in size,
which is common in the marl deposits and peat-bogs
of Ireland and England, and of which remains
have also been dug up in France, Germany,
and Italy, where they were found in the
same strata with bones of elephants. Its wide,
palmated, and branched horns, measure so much
as twelve or fourteen feet from one point to the
other, following the curvatures<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>.</p>

<p>The distinction is not so clear with regard to
the bones of deer and oxen, which have been
collected in certain caverns, and in the fissures of
certain rocks. They are sometimes, and especially
in the caverns of England, accompanied
with bones of elephants, rhinoceroses, and hippopotami,
and with those of a hyena, which also
occurs in several strata of transported matter,
along with these same pachydermata. They are
consequently of the same age; but it remains not
the less difficult to say in what respect they differ
from the oxen and deer of the present day.</p>

<p>The fissures of the rocks of Gibraltar, Cette,
Nice, Uliveta near Pisa, and other places on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
shores of the Mediterranean, are filled with a red
and hard cement, which envelopes fragments of
rock and fresh-water shells, and numerous bones
of quadrupeds, the greater part fractured. These
concretions are termed osseous brecciæ. The
bones which they contain sometimes present characters
sufficient to prove that they have belonged
to unknown animals, or at least to animals foreign
to Europe. There are found, for example,
four species of deer, three of which have characters
in their teeth, which are only observed in
the deer of the Indian Archipelago.</p>

<p>There is a fifth near Verona, the horns of
which exceed in magnitude those of the Canadian
deer<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>.</p>

<p>There also occur, in certain places, along with
bones of rhinoceroses, and other quadrupeds of
this period, those of a deer so much resembling
the reindeer, that it would be difficult to assign
distinctive characters to it; a circumstance which
is so much the more extraordinary, that the reindeer
is at the present day confined to the coldest
regions of the north, while the whole genus of
rhinoceroses belongs to the torrid zone.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>There exist in the strata of which we speak,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
remains of a species very similar to the fallow-deer,
but a third larger,<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> and prodigious quantities
of horns, very much resembling those of our
present stag<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>, as well as bones, very like those of
the aurochs<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> and domestic ox<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>, two very distinct
species, which had been erroneously confounded
by the naturalists who preceded us. The
entire heads, however, resembling those of these
two animals, as well as that of the musk-ox of
Canada<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>, which have often been extracted from
the earth, do not come from localities sufficiently
well determined to enable us to assert that these
species had been contemporaries of the great pachydermata,
of which we have made mention above.</p>

<p>The osseous brecciæ of the shores of the Mediterranean
have also afforded two species of
<em>Lagomys</em>,<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> animals, the genus of which exists at
the present day only in Siberia; two species of
rabbits<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>, lemmings, and rats of the size of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
water-rat and domestic mouse<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>. In the caves
of England two species are also found<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>.</p>

<p>The osseous brecciæ even contain bones of
shrew-mice and lizards<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>.</p>

<p>In certain sandy strata of Tuscany, there are
teeth of a porcupine<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>, and in those of Russia
heads of a species of beaver, larger than ours,
which M. Fischer has named <em>Trogontherium</em><a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>.</p>

<p>But it is more particularly in the class Edentata
that these races of animals belonging to the period
before the last assume a size much superior
to that of their present congeners, and even rise
to a magnitude altogether gigantic.</p>

<p>The <em>Megatherium</em> unites a part of the generic
characters of the armadilloes, with some of those of
the sloths, and is in size equal to the largest rhinoceros.
Its claws must have been of a monstrous
length, and prodigious strength; its whole skeleton
possesses an excessive solidity. It has only as yet
been found in the sandy strata of North America<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p>The <em>Megalonyx</em> has been very similar to it in
its characters, but has been somewhat less; its
claws much longer and sharper in the edges.
Some bones and entire toes of it have been found
in certain caves in Virginia, and in an island on
the coast of Georgia<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>.</p>

<p>These two enormous edentata have only hitherto
presented their remains in America; but
Europe possesses one of the same class which
does not yield to them in magnitude. It is only
known by a single terminal joint of a toe, but this
fragment is sufficient to assure us that it was very
similar to a pangolin or manis, but to a pangolin
of nearly twenty-four feet in length. It lived in
the same districts as the elephants, rhinoceroses,
and gigantic tapirs; for its bones have been
found along with theirs in a sandy deposit in the
county of Darmstadt, not far from the Rhine<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>.</p>

<p>The osseous brecciæ also contain, but very rarely,
bones of carnivora<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>, which are much more
numerous in caverns, that is to say, in cavities
wider and more complicated than the fissures or
veins containing osseous brecciæ. The Jura chain
in particular, is celebrated for them in the part of
it which extends into Germany, where, for ages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
past, incredible quantities have been removed and
destroyed, on account of certain medical virtues
which had been attributed to them, and yet there
still remains enough to fill the mind with astonishment.
The principal part of these remains
consists of bones of a very large species of bear
(<em>Ursus spelæus</em>), which is characterised by a
more prominent forehead than that of any of our
living bears<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>. Along with these bones are found
those of two other species of bear (<em>U. arctoideus</em>
and <em>U. priscus</em>)<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>; those of a hyena (<em>H. fossilis</em>),
allied to the spotted hyena of the Cape, but differing
from it in the form of its teeth and head<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>;
those of two tigers or panthers<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>, of a wolf<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>, a
fox<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>, a glutton<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>, as well as of weasels, viverræ,
and other small carnivora<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>.</p>

<p>Here, also, may be observed that singular association
of animals, the species resembling which
live at the present day in climates so widely separated
from each other as the Cape, the country
of the spotted hyena, and Lapland, the country
of our present gluttons. In like manner we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
have seen in a cave in France, a rhinoceros and a
reindeer by the side of each other.</p>

<p>Bears are of rare occurrence in alluvial strata.
Remains of the large species of the caves (<em>U.
spelæus</em>), are said, however, to have been found in
Austria and Hainaut; and in Tuscany there are
bones of a particular species, remarkable for its
compressed canine teeth (<em>U. cultridens</em>)<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>. The
hyenas are more frequently met with. We have
remains of them in France, found along with
bones of elephants and rhinoceroses. A cave has
lately been discovered in England, which contained
prodigious quantities of them, where they
were found of every age, and of which the soil
presented even their excrements in a sufficient
state of preservation to be easily recognised. It
would appear that they had long lived there, and
that it had been by them that the bones of elephants,
rhinoceroses, hippopotami, horses, oxen,
deer, and various animals of the class of glires,
which are found along with them, and which bear
evident marks of their teeth, had been dragged
into the cave. But what must have been the
soil of England, when these enormous animals
lived upon it, and constituted the prey of ferocious
beasts! These caves contain also bones of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
tigers, wolves and foxes; but the remains of bears
are of excessively rare occurrence in them<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>.</p>

<p>However this may be, we see that, at the epoch
of the animal population which we are now passing
under review, the class of carnivora was numerous
and powerful. It reckoned three bears
with round canine teeth, one with compressed canini,
a large tiger or lion, another feline animal,
of the size of the panther, a hyena, a wolf, a fox,
a glutton, a martin or pole-cat, and a weasel.</p>

<p>The class of glires, composed in general of weak
and small species, has been little observed by the
collectors of fossil remains; and, in all cases,
where the bones of these animals have been found
in the strata or deposits of which we speak, they
also have presented unknown species. Such, in
particular, is a species of Lagomys found in the
osseous brecciæ of Corsica and Sardinia, somewhat
resembling the Lagomys alpinus of the
high mountains of Siberia: so true is it that it is
not always in the torrid zone only, that we are to
seek for the animals which resemble those of this
period.</p>

<p>These are the principal animals, the remains
of which have been found in that mass of earth,
sand, and mud,&mdash;that <em>Diluvium</em>, which everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
covers our large plains, fills our caverns,
and chokes up the fissures in many of our rocks.
They incontestibly formed the population of the
continents, at the epoch of the great catastrophe
which has destroyed their races, and which has
prepared the soil, on which the animals of the
present day subsist.</p>

<p>Whatever resemblance certain of these species
bear to those of our days, it cannot be disputed
that the general mass of this population had a
very different character, and that the greater part
of the races which composed it have been utterly
destroyed.</p>

<p>What astonishes us is, that, among all these
mammifera, the greater number of which have
their congeners at the present day in the warm
parts of the globe, there has not been a single
quadrumanous animal,&mdash;that there has not been
collected a single bone or a single tooth of an ape
or monkey, not so much even as a bone or a tooth
belonging to an extinct species of these animals.</p>

<p>Nor is there any trace of man. All the bones
of our species that have been found along with
those of which we have been speaking, have occurred
accidentally<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>, and their number besides is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
exceedingly small, which assuredly would not have
been the case, if men had then been settled in
the countries which these animals inhabited.</p>

<p>Where, then, was the human race at this period?
Did the last and most perfect of the
works of the Creator nowhere exist? Did the
animals which now accompany him upon the
globe, and of which there are no traces among
these fossil remains, surround him? Were the
countries in which he lived with them swallowed
up, when those which he now inhabits, and whose
former population may have been destroyed by a
great inundation, were laid dry again? These
are questions which the study of fossil remains
does not enable us to solve, and in this discourse
we must not apply for information to other
sources.</p>

<p>This much is certain, that we are now at least
in the midst of a fourth succession of land animals,&mdash;that,
after the age of reptiles, the age of
palæotheria, the age of mammoths, and that of
mastodons and megatheria, has come the age in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
which the human species, aided by some domestic
animals, peaceably governs and fertilizes the
earth, and that it is only in the deposits formed
since the commencement of this age, in alluvial
matters, peat-bogs, and recent concretions, that
bones are found in the fossil state, which belong
all of them to known and still living animals.</p>

<p>Such are the human skeletons of Guadaloupe,
imbedded in a species of travertine formed of land
shells, slate, and fragments of shells and madrepores
of the neighbouring sea; the bones of oxen,
deer, roes, and beavers, common in peat-bogs, and
all the bones of men and domestic animals found
in the mud and sand deposited by rivers, in burying
grounds, and upon ancient fields of battle.</p>

<p>None of these remains belong either to the
great deposit formed at the time of the last catastrophe,
nor to those of preceding ages.</p>

<h3 class="p4"><em>On the birds to which the name of Ibis was given by the
ancient Egyptians.</em></h3>

<p>Every body has heard of the Ibis, a bird to
which the ancient Egyptians rendered a religious
homage; which they reared within the precincts
of their temples; allowed to wander unmolested
through their towns; whose murderer, even although
he had involuntarily become so, was punished
with death<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>; which they embalmed with as
much care as their parents;&mdash;a bird to which they
attributed a virgin purity; an inviolable attachment
to their country, of which it was the emblem,
an attachment so great that it suffered itself
to die of hunger when it was transported elsewhere;&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
bird which possessed instinct enough
to know the increase and waning of the moon,
and to regulate accordingly the quantity of its
daily food, and the development of its young;
which arrested at the frontiers of Egypt the serpents
which would otherwise have carried destruction
into that sacred land<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>, and which inspired
them with such terror that they dreaded its very
feathers<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>;&mdash;a bird, in fine, whose form the gods
would have assumed, had they been forced to adopt
a mortal figure, and into which Mercury
was really transformed, when he had a mind to
traverse the earth, and instruct men in the sciences
and arts.</p>

<p>No other animal could have been so easy to recognize
as this; for there is no other of which the
ancients have left us at once, as of the ibis, excellent
descriptions, accurate and even coloured figures,
and the body itself preserved with its feathers,
under the triple envelope of a preservative
bitumen, thick and close folds of linen, and solid
and well varnished vases. And yet, of all the
modern authors who have spoken of the ibis, there
is but one, the celebrated Bruce, a traveller more
famous for his courage than for the justness of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
opinions in natural history, who has not blundered
respecting the true species of this bird; and
his ideas with regard to this subject, however accurate
they were, have not even been adopted by
naturalists<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>.</p>

<p>After several changes of opinion respecting the
ibis, it was seemingly agreed, at the period when
I published the first edition of this work, to give
the name of Ibis to a bird a native of Africa, almost
of the size of the stork, with white plumage,
having the quills black, perched upon long red
legs, armed with a long arched beak, of a pale yellow
colour, sharp at its edges, rounded at its base,
and notched at its point, and whose face is covered
with a red skin destitute of feathers, which do not
extend farther forward than the eyes.</p>

<p>Such is the Ibis of Perrault<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>, the Ibis candida
of Brisson<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ibis blanc d’Egypte</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
<ins class="corr" id="tn-302" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'of Bufffon'">
of Buffon</ins><a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>, and the Tantalus Ibis of Linnæus, in his
twelfth edition. It was to this same bird, also, that
Blumenbach, while he avowed that it is of very rare
occurrence at the present day, at least in Lower
Egypt, asserted that the Egyptians rendered divine
honours<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>; and yet this naturalist had possessed
opportunities of examining bones of the
true ibis in a mummy which he opened in London<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>.</p>

<p>I also participated in the error of those celebrated
men whom I have just mentioned, until
the moment when I was enabled to examine some
mummies of the ibis by myself. This pleasure
was procured for me, for the first time, by the late
M. Fourcroy, to whom M. Grobert, Colonel of
Artillery, on his return from Egypt, had given
two of these mummies, both taken from the pits
of Saccara. On carefully exposing them, we perceived
that the bones of the embalmed bird were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
much smaller than those of the <em>Tantalus ibis</em> of
naturalists; that they did not much exceed those
of the curlew in size, that its beak resembled that
of the latter, being only a little shorter in proportion
to its thickness, and not at all that of the
tantalus; and, lastly, that its plumage was white
with the quills marked with black, as the ancients
have described it.</p>

<p>We are therefore convinced, that the bird
which the ancient Egyptians embalmed, was by
no means the Tantalus ibis of naturalists, that it
was smaller, and that it was to be sought for in
the curlew genus. We found, after some inquiries,
that the mummies of the ibis which had
been opened before by different naturalists, were
similar to ours. Buffon says expressly that he examined
several of them; that the birds which
they contained had the beak and size of curlews;
and yet he has blindly followed Perrault in taking
the African tantalus for the ibis. One of
those mummies opened by Buffon still exists in
the museum; it is similar to those which we have
examined.</p>

<p>Dr Shaw, in the supplement to his Travels<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>,
describes and figures with care the bones of a similar
mummy. The beak, he says, was six English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
inches in length, similar to that of the curlew,
&amp;c. In a word, its description agrees entirely
with ours.</p>

<p>Caylus, in his Collection of Antiquities, vol.
vi. pl. xl. fig. 1., gives a representation of the
mummy of an ibis, the height of which, with its
bandages, is only one foot seven inches four lines,
although he says expressly that the bird was placed
upon its feet with the head straight out, and that
it had no part inflected in its embalment.</p>

<p>Hasselquist, who took a small white and black
heron for the ibis, gives, as his principal reason,
that the size of this bird, which is that of a crow,
corresponds very well with that of the mummies
of the ibis<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>. How, then, could Linnæus have
given the name of ibis to a bird as large as a
stork? How, especially, could he have considered
this bird to be the same as the Ardea ibis of Hasselquist,
which, besides its smallness, had the beak
straight? And how has this latter error of synonymy
been preserved to this very day in the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Systema Naturæ</i>?</p>

<p>A short time after this examination, which was
made in the presence of M. Fourcroy, M. Olivier<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
had the politeness to shew us the bones which he
had taken from two mummies of the ibis, and to
open along with us two others. These bones were
found similar to those of Colonel Grobert’s mummies;
one of the four only was smaller, but it
was easy to judge by the epiphyses that it had
belonged to a young individual.</p>

<p>The only figure of the beak of an embalmed
ibis, which does not entirely agree with the objects
which we have had under our eyes, is that of Edwards
(pl. cv.); it is a ninth part larger, and yet
we do not doubt its accuracy, for M. Olivier shewed
us also a beak an eighth or a ninth longer than
the others, or in the proportion of 180 to 165,
which had been equally taken from a mummy.
This beak only shews that there were among the
ibises individuals larger than others; but it proves
nothing in favour of the tantalus, for it has not
at all the form of the beak of that animal. Its
beak is perfectly similar to that of the curlews;
and besides, the beak of the tantalus is a third
longer than that of our largest embalmed ibises,
and two-fifths longer than that of the smallest.</p>

<p>We have ascertained further, that similar variations
with regard to the size of the beak exist in
our European curlews, according to the age and
sex. They are still more strongly marked in the
green curlew of Italy, and in our godwits; and
this variation appears to be a property common to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
most of the species of the family of scolopaceous
birds.</p>

<p>Lastly, our naturalists returned from the expedition
to Egypt with a rich harvest of objects, as
well ancient as recent. My learned friend M.
Geoffroy St Hilaire, in particular, had occupied
himself with the greatest care in collecting mummies
of all descriptions, and had brought with
him a great number of those of the ibis, both
from Saccara and Thebes.</p>

<p>The former were in the same state as those
which M. Grobert had brought, that is to say,
their bones had undergone a sort of half burning,
and were without consistence; they broke on the
slightest touch, and it was very difficult to obtain
any entire, and still more so to detach them for
the purpose of making a skeleton.</p>

<p>The bones of those brought from Thebes were
much better preserved, either on account of the
greater heat of the climate, or from the more efficacious
means employed for their preparation;
and M. Geoffroy having sacrificed some of them
to me, M. Rousseau, my assistant, succeeded, by
dint of patience and address, and by the employment
of ingenious and delicate methods of procedure,
in making up an entire skeleton, by stripping
all the bones, and connecting them with a
very fine wire. This skeleton is deposited in the
anatomical galleries of the museum, of which it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
forms one of the most beautiful ornaments, and
we have represented it in Pl. iv.</p>

<p>It is likely that this mummy must have been
that of a bird kept in a state of domesticity in the
temples, for its left humerus has been broken and
joined again. It is probable that a wild bird,
whose wing had been broken, would have perished
before it had healed, from its being unable to pursue
its prey, or to escape from its enemies.</p>

<p>This skeleton puts it in our power to determine,
without any uncertainty, the characters and
proportions of the bird. We see clearly that it
was in all points a true curlew, a little larger than
the common curlew of Europe, but having the
beak thicker and shorter. The following is a
comparative table of the dimensions of the two
birds, taken, for the ibis, from the skeleton of the
mummy of Thebes, and for the curlew, from a
skeleton which previously existed in our anatomical
galleries. We have added those of parts of
the Saccara ibises, which we succeeded in obtaining
entire.</p>

<p>It appears by this table, that the animal of
Thebes was larger than our curlew; that one of
the Saccara ibises was intermediate in size between
that of Thebes and our common curlew,
and that the other was smaller than this latter
bird. It is also seen that the different parts of
the body of the ibis do not observe the same proportions
between each other, as those of the curlew.
The beak of the former, for example, is in
particular shorter, although all the other parts are
longer, &amp;c.</p>

<p>However, these differences of proportions do
not exceed what might be expected in species of
the same genus: the forms and characters which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
may be considered as generic, are absolutely the
same.</p>

<p>We must therefore search for the true ibis, not
among those tantaluses of large size and sharp
beak, but among the curlews; and, let it be observed,
that, by the name <em>curlew</em>, we intend to
signify, not the artificial genus formed by Latham
and Gmelin, of all the wading birds which have
the beak curved downwards, but a natural genus,
to which we shall give the name of <em>Numenius</em>,
and which will comprehend all the waders with
beaks curved downwards, soft and rounded, whether
their head be bare or clothed with feathers.
It is the genus <em>courlis</em>, such as Buffon imagined
it<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>.</p>

<p>A glance over the collection of birds belonging
to the royal cabinet, has enabled us to distinguish
a species, which is neither named nor described in
the works of systematic writers, excepting perhaps
by Dr Latham; and which, when carefully
examined, will be found to correspond with all
that the ancients, the monuments and mummies,
indicate as characteristic of the ibis.</p>

<p>We here present a figure of it, <a href="#PL_V">Plate <span class="allsmcap">V.</span></a> It
is a bird somewhat larger than the curlew; its
beak is arcuate like that of the curlew, but a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
shorter, and sensibly thicker in proportion, somewhat
compressed at its base, and marked on each
side with a groove, which, proceeding from the
nostril, is continued to the extremity; while, in
the curlew, there is a similar groove, which disappears
before arriving at the middle of the beak;
the colour of the beak is more or less black; the
head, and the two upper thirds of the neck, are
entirely destitute of feathers, and the skin of
these parts is black. The plumage of the body,
wings, and tail, is white, with the exception of
the ends of the large quills of the wing, which
are black; the four last secondary quills have the
barbs singularly long, attenuated, and hanging
down over the ends of the wings, when the latter
are folded; their colour is a beautiful black, with
violet reflections. The feet are black, the legs
are thicker, and the toes much longer in proportion
than those of the curlew; the membranes between
the bases of the toes are also more extended;
the leg is entirely covered with small
polygonal, or what is called reticulated scales, and
the base of the toes itself has only similar scales;
while, in the curlew, two-thirds of the leg, and
the whole length of the toes, are scutulate, that
is to say, furnished with transverse scales. There
is a reddish tint under the wing, toward the top
of the thigh, and on the anterior large wing coverts;
but this tint appears to be an individual
character, or the result of an accident, for it does<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
not occur in other individuals that are in other
respects entirely similar.</p>

<p>This first individual came from the collection
of the Stadtholder, and its native country was
unknown. The late M. Desmoulins, assistant
naturalist to the Museum, who had seen two
others, asserted that they came from Senegal;
one of them must even have been brought by M.
Geoffroy de Villeneuve: but we shall see, as we
proceed, that Bruce<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> found this species in Abyssinia,
where it was named <em>Abou-Hannes</em> (Father
John); and that M. Savigny saw it in abundance
in Lower Egypt, where it was called <em>Abou-Mengel</em>
(Father of the Sickle). It is probable
that the moderns will give no credit to the assertion
of the ancients, that the ibis never left
Egypt without perishing<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>. This assertion would,
besides, be as contrary to the Tantalus Ibis as to
our common Curlew; for the individuals which
we have in Europe came from Senegal. It was
from thence that M. Geoffroy de Villeneuve had
brought the individual in the Museum of Natural
History. It is even much rarer in Egypt than
our curlew; for, since Perrault, nobody mentions
having seen it there, or having received it from
that country. An individual without the reddish
tint, but in other respects perfectly similar to the
first, was brought home by M. de Labillardiere,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
in his voyage to Australasia made along with
M. d’Entrecasteux.</p>

<p>We afterwards learned, that, when young,
these birds have the head and neck furnished
with feathers in the part which, as they advance
in age, is to become bare; and that the scapulars
are less elongated, and of a paler and duller black.
It is in this state that one was brought to us from
Australasia by the late Peron, which, in other
respects, differs from ours, and from that of M.
Labillardiere, only in having some black markings
on the alula and first large coverts, and in
which the head and upper part of the neck are
covered with blackish feathers. It was also a
youngish individual which M. Savigny brought
from Egypt, and which is figured in his memoir
upon the Ibis, Plate <span class="allsmcap">I.</span>; and in the great work
on Egypt, under the head Birds, Pl. <span class="allsmcap">VII.</span> The
feathers of the head and back part of the neck
are rather grey than black; those of the fore part
of the neck are white. Lastly, Bruce’s figure
(Atlas, Plate <span class="allsmcap">XXXV.</span>) is also taken from a young
individual observed in Abyssinia, and almost similar
to that of M. Savigny.</p>

<p>We have received from Pondicherry, by M.
Leschenault, an individual similar to that of Peron,
but in which, the head only, and a small part
of the back of the neck, are furnished with blackish
feathers; all the rest is covered with white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
feathers. But it is not the less certain, that all
these birds have the head and the neck bare when
they are full grown.</p>

<p>The late M. Macé sent from Bengal to the
Museum several individuals of a species very
nearly allied to this, which has the beak a little
longer, and less arched, of which the first quill
only has a little black on the two edges of its
point, and of which the secondary quills are also
somewhat attenuated, and slightly tinged with
reddish.</p>

<p>It appears, according to M. Savigny, p. 25,
that M. Levaillant observed another still, which
has the secondary quills similarly elongated, but
of which the neck always retains its feathers, and
whose face is of a red colour.</p>

<p>The same M. Macé also sent us a tantalus,
very much resembling that which has been regarded
by naturalists as the ibis, but of which
the small wing-coverts, and a broad band at the
lower part of the breast, are black, and speckled
with white. The last secondary quills are elongated,
and tinged with rose-colour. It is known
that, in the Tantalus ibis of naturalists, the small
wing-coverts are speckled with purplish red, and
that the whole under part of the body is white.</p>

<p>We give here a table of the parts of some of
these birds, which could be accurately measured
in stuffed individuals. By comparing them with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
those of the skeletons of embalmed ibises, one
may judge if it were possible to believe for a
single moment that these mummies belonged to
the tantalus.</p>

<p>Let us now examine the books of the ancients
and their monuments; let us compare what they
have said of the ibis, or the figures of it which
they have traced, with the bird which we have
been describing; and we shall see all our difficulties
vanishing, and all the testimonies according
with what is best of all for the purpose, the
body itself of the bird preserved in the mummy.</p>

<p>“The most common ibises,” says Herodotus,
(Euterpe, No. 76.) “have the head and the fore-part
of the neck bare, the plumage white, excepting
on the head, the nape, the ends of the wings
and of the rump, which are black.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> Their beak
and feet are similar to those of the other
ibises.”</p>

<p>How does it happen that the travellers of our
times do not make so good descriptions of the
birds which they observe as that which Herodotus
has made of the ibis? How could this description
have been applied to a bird which has
only the face bare, and which has that part of a
red colour, to a bird which has the rump white,
and not covered over at least as ours by the black
feathers of the wings?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span></p>

<p>And yet this latter character was essential to
the ibis. Plutarch (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Iside et Osiride</span>) says,
that the manner in which the white was cut by
the black in the plumage of this bird, presented
the form of a lunar crescent. It is, in fact, by
the union of the black of the last quills, with
that of the two ends of the wings, that there is
formed, in the white, a large semicircular notch,
which gives to the white the figure of a crescent.</p>

<p>It is more difficult to explain what he has
intended to say, in averring that the feet of
the ibis form an equilateral triangle with its
beak. But we can understand the assertion of
Ælian, that when it draws in its head and neck
among its feathers, it represents, in some measure,
the figure of a heart.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> It was on account
of this, according to Horus Apollo (c. 35.), the
emblem of the human heart.</p>

<p>From what Herodotus says of the nakedness
of the throat, and of the feathers which covered
the upper part of the neck, he appears to have
had under his eyes a middle aged individual; but
it is not the less certain, that the Egyptians also
knew very well the individuals with the neck entirely
bare. We see such represented from sculptures
in bronze, in Caylus’s Collection of Egyptian
Antiquities (vol. i. pl. x. no. 4., and vol. v.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
pl. xi. no. 1.) This last figure is even so like
our bird represented in pl. v., that it might be
said that it was taken from it.</p>

<p>The paintings of Herculaneum no longer leave
any doubt on the subject. Plates 138 and 140
of David’s edition, and vol. ii. p. 315, pl. 59, and
p. 321, pl. 60 of the original edition, which represent
Egyptian ceremonies, shew several ibises
walking in the court of the temples. The characteristic
blackness of the head and neck are in
particular recognised, and it is easily seen from
the proportion which their figure bears to the
persons in the painting, that it must have been a
bird of half a metre at the most, and not of a
metre, or thereabouts, like the Tantalus ibis.</p>

<p>The mosaic of Palestine, also presents in its
middle part several ibises perched upon buildings.
They differ in nothing from those of the paintings
of Herculaneum. A Sardonyx of Dr
Mead’s Collection, copied by Shaw, App. pl. v.,
and representing an ibis, seems to be a miniature
of the bird which we have described. A medal
of Adrian, in large bronze, represented in the
Farnesian Museum, vol. vi. pl. xxviii. fig. 16,
and another of the same emperor, in silver, represented
in vol. iii. pl. vi. fig. 9, afford figures of
the ibis, which, notwithstanding their smallness,
are pretty like our bird.</p>

<p>With regard to the figures of the ibis, sculp<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>tured
upon the plinth of the statue of the Nile,
at Belvedere, and upon the copy of it at the garden
of the Tuileries, they are not sufficiently
finished to serve as proofs; but among the hieroglyphics
of which the Institute of Egypt has
caused impressions to be made upon the spot,
there are several which distinctly represent our
bird. In <a href="#PL_III">plate iii</a>. fig. 1, we give one of these
impressions which M. Geoffroy has had the politeness
to communicate to us.</p>

<p>We insist particularly on this latter figure,
because it is the most authentic of all, having
been made at the time, and on the spot where
the ibis was worshipped, and being cotemporary
with its mummies; while those which we have
cited above, having been made in Italy, and by
artists who did not profess the Egyptian worship,
might have been less faithful.</p>

<p>We owe to Bruce the justice of saying, that
he recognised the bird which he describes under
the name of <em>Abou-Hannes</em>, as the true ibis.
He says expressly, that this bird appeared to him
to resemble that which the mummy pitchers contained;
and further, that this Abou-Hannes, or
<em>Father John</em>, is very common on the banks of
the Nile, while he never saw there the bird represented
by Buffon, under the name of the
White Ibis of Egypt.</p>

<p>M. Savigny, one of the naturalists of the ex<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>pedition
to Egypt, equally asserts his not having
seen the <em>Tantalus</em> in that country, but he obtained
a great number of our <em>Numenius</em> near
the Lake Menzale, in Lower Egypt, and carried
their skins with him.</p>

<p>The Abou-Hannes has been placed by Latham,
in his <cite>Index Ornithologicus</cite>, under the
name of <em>Tantalus Æthiopicus</em>; but he does
not speak of Bruce’s conjecture respecting its
identity with the ibis. The travellers before and
after Bruce appear to have all been in error. Belon
thought that the white ibis was the stork, in
which he evidently contradicted all testimony on
that head. No person has adopted his opinion
in this matter, excepting the apothecaries, who
have taken the stork for an emblem, because they
have confounded it with the ibis, to which the
invention of clysters is attributed<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>.</p>

<p>Prosper Alpinus, who relates that this invention
is due to the ibis, gives no description of
this bird in his Medicine of the Egyptians<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>. In
his Natural History of Egypt, he speaks of it
only after Herodotus, to whose account he only
adds, without doubt from a passage of Strabo,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
which I shall mention farther on, that that bird
resembles the stork in size and figure. He mentions
his having been informed that white and
black ones occurred in abundance on the edges of
the Nile; but it is evident from his very expressions,
that he did not believe it had been seen
there<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>.</p>

<p>Shaw says of the ibis,<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> that it is at the present
day excessively rare, and that he has never seen
it. His <em>Emseesy</em>, or ox-bird, which Gmelin
very improperly refers to the Tantalus Ibis, is of
the size of the curlew, with the body white, and
the beak and feet red. It frequents the meadows,
where it follows the cattle; its flesh is not
well tasted, and corrupts quickly. It is easy to
see that this is not the Tantalus, and still less the
Ibis of the ancients.</p>

<p>Hasselquist was not acquainted with the white
Ibis nor with the black one, his <em>Ardea Ibis</em> is a
small heron, which has the beak straight. Linnæus
had acted very properly in placing it among
the herons, in his tenth edition; but he erred, as
I have said, in transporting it afterwards as a synonym
to the genus <em>Tantalus</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span></p>

<p>Demaillet<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> conjectures that the ibis might be
the bird peculiar to Egypt, and which was named
Pharaoh’s Fowl (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chapon de Pharaon</i>), and at
Aleppo <em>Saphan-bacha</em>. It devours serpents.
There are of them white, and white and black;
and it follows, for more than a hundred leagues,
the caravans which go from Cairo to Mecca, for
the purpose of feeding upon the carcases of animals
which are killed during the journey, while
at any other time there is not one seen along this
route. But the author does not consider this conjecture
as certain; he even says, that we must
give up understanding the ancients, when they
have spoken so as not to be understood. He
ends with concluding, that the ancients have
perhaps indiscriminately comprehended under the
name of Ibis, all birds which rendered to Egypt
the service of clearing it of the dangerous reptiles
which this climate produces in abundance, such
as the vulture, the falcon, the stork, the sparrowhawk,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>He had reason not to regard his Pharaoh’s
fowl as the ibis; for, although its description is
very imperfect, and although Buffon fancied he
recognised the ibis in it, it is easy to judge, as
well as by what Pokocke says of it, that this bird<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
must be a carnivorous one; and, in fact, we see
from Bruce’s figure (Vol. v. p. 191. of the French
edition), that Pharaoh’s fowl is nothing else than
the <em>rachama</em> or the small white vulture with black
wings (<em>Vultur perenopterus</em>, Linn.)&mdash;a bird very
different from what we have proved above to be
the ibis.</p>

<p>Pokocke says that it appears, from the descriptions
which are given of the ibis, and from
the figures which he has seen of it in the temples
of Upper Egypt, that it was a species of Crane.
I have seen, he adds, a number of these birds in
the islands of the Nile; they were for the most
part greyish<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>. These few words suffice to prove
that he did not know the ibis better than the
others.</p>

<p>The learned have not been more happy in their
conjectures than the travellers. Middleton refers
to the ibis, a bronze figure of a bird, of which the
beak is arched, but short, the neck very long, and
the head furnished with a small crest, a figure
which never had any resemblance to the bird of
the Egyptians<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>. This figure is, besides, not at all
in the Egyptian style, and Middleton himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
agrees that it must have been made at Rome.
Saumaise upon Solinus says nothing that relates
to the present question.</p>

<p>As to the black ibis, which Aristotle places
only near Pelusium<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>; it was long thought that
Belon alone had seen it<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>. The bird which he
describes under this name is a species of curlew,
to which he attributes a head similar to that of
the cormorant, that is to say, apparently bald, a
red beak, and feet of the same colour; but as he
does not speak of the ibis in his journey<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>, I suppose
that it was only in France that he made this
reference, and by comparison with mummies of
the Ibis. What is certain is, that this curlew,
with the beak and feet red, was not known in
Egypt<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>, but that our green curlew of Europe
(<em>Scolopax Falcinellus</em>, Linn. Pl. Enl. 819.)
is seen very commonly there, that it is even more
abundant than the white numenius<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>; and, as it
resembles it in form and size, and, further, as its
plumage may appear black, it can by no means be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
doubted that it was the true black ibis of the
ancients. M. Savigny also made a drawing of it
in Egypt, but from a young individual only<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>.
Buffon’s figure is from an adult bird; but its colours
are too pale.</p>

<p>The error which prevails at present respecting
the white ibis began with Perrault, who was also
the first naturalist who made known the Tantalus
ibis of the present day. This error, adopted
by Brisson and Buffon, passed into the twelfth
edition of Linnæus, where it is blended with that
of Hasselquist, which had been inserted in the
tenth, forming with it a compound altogether
monstrous.</p>

<p>It was founded on the idea, that the ibis was
essentially a bird that destroyed serpents, and
upon this very natural conclusion, that, in order
to enable it to devour these reptiles, it was necessary
for it to have a sharp beak, more or less resembling
that of the heron. This idea is even
the only good objection that can be made against
the identity of our bird to the ibis. How, it is
urged, could a bird with a weak bill, a curlew,
devour those dangerous reptiles?</p>

<p>It may be replied, that positive proofs, such
descriptions, figures, and mummies, ought always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
to preponderate over accounts of habits too often
imagined without any other motive than to justify
the different worships rendered to animals.
It might be added, the serpents from which the
ibis delivered Egypt, are represented to us as very
venomous, but not as very large. I have even
obtained a direct proof that the birds preserved
as mummies, which have had a beak precisely similar
to that of our bird, were true serpent eaters;
for I found in one of their mummies the still
undigested remains of the skin and scales of serpents,
which I have deposited in our anatomical
galleries.</p>

<p>But, at the present day, M. Savigny, who has
observed, in a living state, and more than once
dissected our white numenius, the bird which
every thing concurs to prove to have been the
ibis, asserts that it only eats worms, fresh water
shells, and other small animals of that sort. Supposing
this fact to have no exception, all that
can be concluded from it is, that the Egyptians,
as has happened more than once to them and
others, had invented a false reason for an absurd
worship. It is true that Herodotus says, he saw,
in a place on the borders of the desert<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>, near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
Buto, a narrow gorge, in which a multitude of
bones were heaped up, which he was informed
were remains of winged serpents, that were seeking
to penetrate into Egypt in spring, and that
the ibises had arrested their passage. But he
does not say that he had witnessed their combats,
or that he had seen those winged serpents in their
entire state. The whole of his testimony, therefore,
reduces itself to this, that he had observed a
heap of bones, which may very well have been
those of the multitude of reptiles and other animals
which the inundation destroyed every year,
and whose bodies it would naturally carry to the
places where it was stopped, to the borders of the
desert, and which must by preference have accumulated
in a narrow gorge.</p>

<p>However, it is equally from this idea of the
combats of the ibis with serpents, that Cicero
gives that bird a horny and strong beak<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>. Having
never been in Egypt, he imagined that this
must have been the case by mere analogy.</p>

<p>I am aware that Strabo says somewhere, that
the ibis resembles the stork in form and size<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>,
and that this author ought to have known it well,
since he asserts that in his time the streets and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
cross-ways of Alexandria were so filled with them,
that they proved a great inconvenience; but he
must have spoken of it from memory. His testimony
cannot be received when he contradicts all
the rest, and especially when the bird itself is
there to refute him.</p>

<p>In like manner, I shall not trouble myself
about the passage where Ælian<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> relates, according
to the Egyptian embalmers, that the intestines
of the ibis are eighty-six cubits long. The
Egyptian priests of all classes have been guilty of
so many extravagancies with regard to Natural
History, that no great importance can be attributed
to what one of their lowest classes might aver.</p>

<p>An objection might still be drawn against my
opinion from the long attenuated and black feathers
which cover the rump of our bird, and of
which some traces also are seen in Bruce’s figure
of the Abou-Hannes. The ancients, it might be
said, do not speak of them in their descriptions,
and their figures do not exhibit them. But I
have more on my side, in respect to this matter,
than a written testimony or a figured representation.
I have found precisely the same feathers
in one of the Saccara mummies; I kept them
carefully as being at once a singular monument<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
of antiquity and a peremptory proof of the identity
of species. These feathers having an uncommon
form, and not occurring, I believe, in any
other curlew, leave, in fact, no doubt respecting
the accuracy of my opinion.</p>

<p>I conclude this memoir with a view of its results:</p>

<p>1. The Tantalus Ibis of Linnæus ought to
constitute a separate genus, along with the <em>Tantalus
Loculator</em>. Their character would be:
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rostrum læve, validum, arcuatum, apice utrinque
emarginatum</i>.</p>

<p>2. The other Tantali of the last editions should
form a genus with the common curlews, to which
the name of <em>Numenius</em> might be given. The
character of the genus would be: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rostrum teres,
gracile, arcuatum, apice mutico</i>. For the special
character of the subgenus of the Ibises, there
should be added: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sulco laterali per totam longitudinem
exarato</i>.</p>

<p>3. The white ibis of the ancients is not the ibis
of Perrault and Buffon, which is a <em>Tantalus</em>; nor
the ibis of Hasselquist, which is an <em>Ardea</em>; nor
the ibis of Maillet, which is a <em>Vulture</em>; but it is a
bird of the genus Numenius, and of the sub-genus
Ibis, which has hitherto been described and figured
only by Bruce, under the name of <em>Abou-Hannes</em>.
I give it the name of <span class="smcap">Numenius ibis</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">albus, capite et collo adulti nudis, remigum apicibus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
rostro et pedibus nigris, remigibus secondariis
elongatis nigro-violaceis</i>.</p>

<p>4. The black ibis of the ancients is probably
the bird which we know in Europe under the
name of Green Curlew, or the <em>Scolopax Falcinellus</em>
of Linnæus. It also belongs to the genus
Numenius, and to the sub-genus Ibis.</p>

<p>5. The <em>Tantalus Ibis</em> of Linnæus, in the present
state of synonymy, comprehends four species
of three different genera, namely,</p>

<p>1. A Tantalus, the ibis of Perrault and Buffon;</p>

<p>2. An Ardea, the ibis of Hasselquist;</p>

<p>3. and 4. Two Numenii, the ibis of Belonius,
and the ox-bird of Shaw.</p>

<p>From this example, and so many others, one
may judge of the state in which the <cite>Systema Naturæ</cite>
still exists, which it would be of so much
advantage to purge by degrees of the errors with
which it abounds, and which would seem to be
every day increasing, by the addition of species,
characters, and synonyms, made without selection
and without critical examination.</p>

<p>The general conclusion of the whole investigation
is, that the Ibis still exists in Egypt, as it
did in the days of the Pharaohs, and, that it was
owing to the inaccuracy of naturalists that the
species was for some time thought to be extinct,
or to have been altered in its forms.</p>

<h3><em>On the Subsidence of Strata.</em></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="fs150">M.</span> Cuvier adopts the opinion of De Luc, that all the
older strata of which the crust of the earth is composed,
were originally in an horizontal situation, and have been
raised into their present highly-inclined position, by subsidences
that have taken place over the whole surface of
the earth.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted, that subsidences, to a considerable
extent, have taken place; yet we are not of opinion
that these have been so general as maintained by these
geologists. We are rather inclined to believe, that the
present inclined position of strata is in general their original
one;&mdash;an opinion which is countenanced by the
known mode of connection of strata, the phenomena of
veins, particularly contemporaneous veins, the crystalline
nature of every species of older rock, and the great
regularity in the <em>direction</em> of strata throughout the
globe.</p>

<p>The transition and flœtz-rocks also are much more of
a chemical or crystalline nature than has been generally
imagined. Even sandstone, one of the most abundant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
of the flœtz-rocks, occasionally occurs in masses, many
yards in extent, which individually have a tabular or
stratified structure; but, when viewed on the great scale,
appear to be great massive distinct concretions. These
massive concretions, with their subordinate tabular structures,
if not carefully investigated, are apt to bewilder
the mineralogist, and to force him to have recourse to a
general system of subsidence or elevation of the strata,
in order to explain the phenomena they exhibit.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap"><a id="NOTE_C"></a>Note C</span>, <a href="#Page_13">p. 13.</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Deluge.</span></h3>

<p>There are many facts, some of which are recorded in
the Bible, that are hostile to Cuvier and De Luc’s opinions
stated in the text, viz. that the bed of the ocean
was changed at the flood, or last great catastrophe; and
that the land, formerly occupied by animals, was henceforth
given up to fishes and other marine tribes. We
are told, for example, that the dove, which was sent
forth from the ark, found an olive-tree, whence it
plucked a leaf, to carry back to the patriarch, as a proof
that the waters of the deluge were subsiding; and we
also find that the Assyrian rivers, which originally
marked the situation of Eden, retained the same geographical
relations after the earth had been repeopled.
The natural history of the fossil organic remains contained
in alluvial deposits, is also in opposition to the
opinion of De Luc.</p>

<h3 class="fs70">FORMATION OF PRIMITIVE MOUNTAINS.</h3>

<p>Mitscherlich, in a memoir read before the Royal Academy
of Berlin, but not yet published, enters fully into
the illustration of the igneous origin of mountains, especially
those of the primitive class, deducible from his
experiments on the formation of minerals by fusion.
As the view is interesting, we shall here give a short
sketch of it.</p>

<p>Have the primitive mountains of our globe, whose
form necessarily supposes a fluid state, been dissolved
in water; or has the temperature of our earth been
raised to such a degree, that the substances of which
our primitive mountains are formed have become fluid?
This question has been differently answered, and the
solutions given have been attempted to be supported in
proportion as the observation of geological facts, and
the inquiries instituted with reference to the chemical
combinations which compose the earth, have been developed.
New observations, and the discovery of unknown
laws in chemistry and mineralogy, must, at the same
time, open a new field for speculation and observation
in geology. Of the discoveries of our own times, there
certainly is none which has exercised a greater influence
upon mineralogy than that of determinate proportions,
and especially the result of the researches of Berzelius,
that the chemical combinations which nature produces,
are formed according to the laws which he has discovered
with regard to artificial combinations; a result which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
has entirely changed the aspect of this science, and has
elicited a new system of mineralogy, in which the natural-chemical
combinations are ranked with those which
are artificial; which affords a confirmation to the laws
of crystallography, as being the same in both cases.</p>

<p>It has been objected to the truth of the position, that
the laws of natural combinations are the same as those
which artificial combinations follow; that chemistry can
decompose minerals; but that, in the formation of these
combinations, natural laws have been in activity, which
art would in vain attempt to reproduce: but this objection
is groundless. The chemical affinity which acts in
artificial combinations is a power of nature, as well as
the affinity which regulates the composition of natural
combinations: chemical affinity, in general, is a quality
of matter. In this objection, modifying circumstances
have been confounded with laws. The chemist would
very easily refute the objection, if he could compose
minerals of their elements, and produce artificial combinations
similar in all their characters to minerals themselves.
From such researches, there would, at the same
time, be diffused a new light upon geological investigations.
In this manner many phenomena would be reproduced,
which have taken place at the formation of the
earth; geological observations would be repeated by experiments,
which might be varied at pleasure, for confirming
these observations; and the recurrence in nature
itself would be sought of those phenomena which have
been produced in the laboratory;&mdash;inquiries, which are,
however, of great importance, because they may be arbitrarily
disposed and arranged according to the theory
in view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span></p>

<p>The importance of such attempts shew the value of
any experiments that go to prove the formation of minerals
by artificial means; and Mitscherlich has been very
successful in detecting several mineral species formed artificially.</p>

<p>Berzelius has shown, in his Chemical System of Mineralogy,
that the greater part of the chemical combinations
of which our Earth is composed, and especially the
primitive mountains, are analogous to salts and double
salts; and that, in these combinations, the silica, carbonic
acid, and oxide of iron, act the part of acids; the
silica combines with the alumina, lime, magnesia, protoxide
and peroxide of iron, protoxide of manganese,
potash and soda, forming, with these bases, either simple
salts, or double salts, in proportions determined by the
different degrees of saturation; the carbonic acid is combined
with the lime and manganese, and the peroxide of
iron with the protoxide.</p>

<p>The object which should be proposed in these attempts,
of which we speak, is to investigate the relation
of these bases to the three acids. We find ourselves
fortunately seconded in this attempt by a branch of national
industry; for the complete extraction of the
greater number of metals depends upon the relation of
the silica to the above-mentioned bases, the degrees of
saturation in which the silica may occur with them, the
greater or less degree of affinity with which these bases
combine with the silica, and, lastly, the chemical qualities
of the combination formed. It is necessary for the
metallurgist that he endeavour, in order to attain his
object completely, to produce, in proportion as the minerals
differ, different chemical combinations of the sub<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>stances
which compose these minerals; but always in
determinate proportions, either by adding a foreign substance,
or by regulating the fusion by the choice of minerals.
The combinations which the metallurgist thus
produces, are ordinarily minerals which have already
been found in nature, sometimes even new species.</p>

<p>During a journey in Sweden, Mitscherlich observed at
Fahlun, where he made inquiries regarding the ores, the
scoriæ, and in general regarding the extraction of copper,
in order to form a correct idea of this operation, not only
some well-formed crystals in the scoriæ; but also
found that the whole mass of the slag had a crystalline
texture; and that the crystals, and the joints of the
slags which had a lamellar texture, remained the same
at different periods of fusion, provided only that the
manner of operating of the metallurgist remained the
same. The examination of the crystalline figure of the
slag proved, that it was that of a mineral which has a
composition analogous to that of the slag. After having
made this observation, he found in almost every foundery
which he visited in Sweden, different crystalline
combinations, which resembled minerals. Thus he found
at Fahlun, silicate and bisilicate of protoxide of iron; at
Garpenberg, mica, and several times augite and chrysolite.
These combinations have not only the same crystalline
figures, but also all the other characters of the corresponding
minerals.</p>

<p>I have pursued these inquiries, says Mitscherlich, since
my return from Sweden; I have analysed the productions
which I have found, and the analysis has confirmed
what the exterior had led to anticipate. I have also augmented
my observations by journeys in various districts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
of Germany; and farther, I have been seconded in my
researches by my friends; so that I now possess upwards
of forty different species of crystallized chemical combinations
produced by fusion, the greater number of which
are minerals already known; some are new species,
which have not hitherto been met with in nature.</p>

<p>The occurrence of mica, which forms a predominant
constituent part of our primitive mountains, as an artificial
production, gave rise to the following geological
speculations.</p>

<p>The artificial production by fusion, of the minerals
which compose our primitive rocks, appears, according
to Mitscherlich, to place beyond doubt the theory that
our primitive mountains were formerly a melted mass.
Such a state of fluidity, he continues, affords an easy
explanation of the figure of the Earth, of the increase of
temperature as we proceed into its interior, of hot springs,
and of many other phenomena. With respect to this
theory, we may refer to M. Laplace, who is convinced
of its plausibility, without grounding his belief upon
the reasons which chemistry presents. I propose, however,
to make mention of a few facts, in order to shew
with what facility many chemical phenomena in geology
may be explained by following this theory.</p>

<p>Primitive mountains are generally distributed over
the surface of the earth: it necessarily follows that the
bodies which have composed the surface of the earth
have participated of the temperature which the primitive
mountains have had at the period when they were
in a fluid state. The temperature at which water boils
depends upon the pressure of the atmosphere; and if
the temperature of the earth increases, we only require<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
to diminish the mean height of the sea 32 feet, in order
to have a pressure of an atmosphere more; and it is by
this pressure that the degree of temperature at which
water boils will also be raised higher. M. Laplace
judges from the height of the sea during flowing and
ebbing, that the mean depth of the sea is about 96,000
feet. Supposing three-fourths of this mass of water
were converted into vapour, the pressure of this vapour
would be nearly equal to 2250 atmospheres; and this
pressure would so augment the degree of heat at which
water enters into ebullition, that the primitive mountains
might be in a state of fusion, without the water with
which they are covered being heated to the boiling
point; for the water which is not converted into vapour,
and whose quantity is a fourth of the whole mass of
vapour, according to the supposition which we have
made, would cover the whole earth, because water expands
in increasing proportion if the temperature be
raised, and because the expansion of water is much
greater than that of the mass of our primitive mountains;
and, consequently, according to this supposition,
our primitive mountains are formed, covered with red
hot water. The great pressure of so many atmospheres
necessarily modifies the reciprocal affinities of the substances
which compose the primitive mountains.</p>

<p>Primitive mountains are distinguished from volcanic
productions in this, that the lime and magnesia, which
in them are combined with carbonic acid, form with the
silex silicates and bisilicates. It is necessary that the
silex, which, under the ordinary pressure, and at an elevated
temperature, expels the carbonic acid, exercise no
influence under the pressure of so many atmospheres;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
and it is not surprising that crystals of quartz occur in
Carrara marble. In volcanic productions, this pressure
no longer exists, and we should find among these the
same phenomena which our laboratories and metallurgic
operations present. Following this theory, the circumstances
that primitive mountains contain gypsum and
carbonates, and that water occurs in quartz, very readily
admit of explanation. And with regard to this latter
phenomenon, the observations detailed by Sir Humphry
Davy afford an additional confirmation of the theory in
question.</p>

<p>We may explain in the same manner another phenomenon,
which is more in connection with the present
state of our globe. Many observations shew that the
sea stood formerly at a much higher level than it does
at present. The water of the sea expands, if the temperature
be elevated more than the land. Admitting
that the surface of the earth has a temperature of 80° of
Reaumur, and that the mean depth of the sea may be
96,000 feet, the height of the sea would then be 4000
feet higher than it is at present. If we suppose, as may
be done without committing any great error, that the
expansion of the primitive mountains is equal to that of
glass, and that they have been at a temperature of 200°,
and even at a much lower one, the water of the sea
would cover the secondary mountains, in which we find
the remains of marine animals. This explanation of the
former height of the sea appears very simple, because
the elevated temperature of the earth may have resulted
either from its original state of fluidity, or from a geological
revolution, which has destroyed, at the same time,
the organic beings of a former period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span></p>

<p>If primitive mountains and volcanic formations have
been fluid, and have crystallised on cooling, it is necessary
that we should retrace in them the same phenomena
and the same laws which we still observe at the present
time. If a fluid body become solid by cooling, these phenomena
are differently modified, according to the chemical
nature of the bodies, and according to the crystalline
forms which they acquire on cooling; but the laws remain
always the same. Mitscherlich says, I am in possession of
some specimens which explain several of the phenomena
so often shewn by basalt and volcanic formations. I do
not possess artificial basalt resembling the natural columnar
kind; yet the slags obtained at the furnaces of
Sahla resemble basalt so perfectly, as to deceive the most
experienced eye, especially as their cavities contain crystals
of augite. But I have found at Fahlun a bisilicate
of protoxide of iron, which has in consequence a composition
analogous to that of basalt, and which has distinct
joints. In this slag we perceive that the joints,
which are parallel to the axis of the prism and to the
lateral planes of the crystals, are always perpendicular
to the plane of cooling. This is particularly observable
in a specimen which was obtained by melting the slag in
a mould; on crystallizing it had several planes of cooling,
and the joints are parallel to each of these planes.
The planes of separation in basalt present exactly the
same phenomenon as this slag.</p>

<p>The phenomena which take place when a fluid body
crystallizes may be observed in sulphur, better than in
any other body. All fluid bodies, however, and even
water, on freezing, present the same phenomena.</p>

<p>If a fluid body has cooled to the point at which it be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>gins
to become solid, for example, sulphur, in a round
vessel, a crust of sulphur is not formed upon the surface
of the cooled vessel, and another crust upon the surface
of the sulphur itself, as might be expected; on the contrary,
if a crystal be formed upon a point of the inner
surface of the vessel, the crystal enlarges by growing in
the direction of its axis, and the mass which surrounds
the crystal remains liquid, and sometimes cools, without
the molecules arranging themselves in the same manner
as the crystal already formed. On examining the cooled
mass, we observe that it shews a lamellar texture where
the crystal was formed, and that the mass which surrounded
it does not shew this texture in the same degree.
This explains how veins of large-granular granite traverse
a small-granular granite, as well as other phenomena of
the same nature.</p>

<p>This observation also affords an explanation of another
phenomenon. If the half of the liquid mass has
become solid, and if the fluid part be poured off, we obtain
isolated crystals, which have been formed in the
fluid mass. If the fluid part be not poured off, and be
permitted to cool slowly, it contracts, as is the case with
most bodies, and the contraction produces the same effect
as the decantation; small cavities will be formed,
and these will be traversed and covered over with distinct
crystals. We also observe this phenomenon in the
geodes of primitive and volcanic mountains, in which
the crystals they contain are of the same minerals as those
of which the mountains themselves are composed.</p>

<h3 class="fs70">ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF BOULDER STONES IN SCOTLAND,
HOLLAND, GERMANY, SWITZERLAND, AND AMERICA.</h3>

<p>Numerous large blocks are met with in almost every
country of Europe, and frequently far removed from
their original situations. This is frequently the case in
Scotland: thus, in the Edinburgh district, we have numerous
blocks of primitive rocks, of which no fixed rocks
occur nearer than in our Highland mountains.</p>

<p>In the north of Holland, Germany, and the countries
bordering on the Baltic, enormous fragments of granite
and syenite are scattered within certain limits. According
to Humboldt, it seems to be now proved, that they
have been carried southward, with a distribution like
that of radii from a centre, from the Scandinavian peninsula,
during some of the ancient revolutions of our globe,
and that they have not originally belonged to the granitic
chains of the Hartz and Saxony, which they approach
without, however, actually attaining their basis<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>.
Born, says Humboldt, on the sandy plains of the Baltic,
and until the age of eighteen, not knowing any other
rock than these scattered blocks, I could not but feel
curious to know whether the new world presented any
thing of a similar nature. I was surprised not to find a
single block of this description in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Llanos</i> of Venezuela,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
although the immense plains were immediately
bordered to the south by a group of mountains entirely
granitic<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>, and which presents, in its broken and almost
columnar peaks, traces of the most violent action<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>.
Towards the north, the granitic chain of the Silla of Caracas
and of Portocabello is separated from the Llanos,
by a range of mountains which are schistose between
Villa de Cura and Parapara, and calcareous between the
Bergantin and Caripe. I was equally struck with the
same absence of blocks upon the banks of the Amazon.
La Condamine had already affirmed, that from the Pongo
of Manseriche to the strait of Pauxis, not the smallest
stone was to be observed. Now, the basin of the
Rio Nigro and of the Amazon is also but a Llano,
a plain like those of Venezuela and Buenos Ayres, the
difference consisting only in the state of the vegetation.
The two Llanos, situated at the northern and southern
extremities of South America, are covered with gramineæ;
they are Savannas destitute of trees. The intermediate
Llano, that of the Amazon, exposed to almost
continual equatorial rains, is a thick forest. I do not
remember to have heard that the Pampas of Buenos
Ayres or the Savannas of the Missouri<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> and New
Mexico contain granitic blocks. The absence of this
phenomenon appears general in the new world. It
is probably equally so in the Sahara in Africa; for we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
must not confound rocky masses which pierce the soil in
the midst of the desert, and of which mention has often
been made by travellers, with mere scattered fragments.
These facts seem to prove, that the blocks of Scandinavian
granite, which cover the sandy plains on the southern
side of the Baltic, in Westphalia, and in Holland,
are owing to a particular debacle which proceeded from
the north, to a purely local catastrophe. The old conglomerate
(<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grès rouge</span>), which covers a great part of the
Llanos of Venezuela and of the basin of the Amazon,
contains, without doubt, fragments of those same primitive
rocks of which the neighbouring mountains are composed;
but the convulsions of which these mountains
present undoubted evidences, do not seem to have been
accompanied with circumstances favourable to the transportation
of great blocks. This geognostic phenomenon
is so much the more unexpected, that nowhere in the world
does there exist a plain so continuous, and which is prolonged
with fewer interruptions to the abrupt declivity
of a purely granitic cordillera. Before my departure
from Europe, says Humboldt, I had already been struck
with the observation that there are no primitive blocks
in Lombardy, nor in the great plain of Bavaria, which
is the bottom of an ancient lake, having an elevation of
250 fathoms above the level of the ocean. This plain is
bounded on the north by the granites of the Upper Palatinate,
and on the south by the alpine limestones, transition
clay-slates, and mica-slates of the Tyrol.</p>

<p>Boulders, or loose blocks of alpine rocks, are found in
the lower part of the Alpine valleys, which terminate in the
great principal valley that stretches between the Alps and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
the Jura, from the Lake of Geneva to the Lake Constance;
and are also found almost every where in this great principal
valley. They are sometimes met with 4000 feet
above the level of the sea, on the side of the Jura, facing
the Alps, and also in considerable numbers in many of
the valleys of the Jura itself. These blocks occur only
on the surface, never in any solid rock, and no one ever
met with them in the subjacent strata of sandstone, marl,
or conglomerate of the hills and valleys, interposed between
the Alps and the Jura; but they are sometimes
found deep in the soil, or imbedded or surrounded with
the debris formed by rivers.</p>

<p>The traveller is often surprised by the enormous magnitude
of these loose blocks, some of them being calculated
to contain 50,000 cubic feet. The smaller masses
are distinguished from those brought down by rivers,
by their position, that is, their occurring on heights and
acclivities, where no river could ever have run. They
may also be confounded with blocks from decaying conglomerate;
hence it is proper to be on our guard, not only
to distinguish these blocks from those derived from
conglomerate rocks, but also from the rolled masses belonging
to river courses.</p>

<p>The height at which they are found does not appear
to have any relation to their magnitude, for we often
find very large blocks at considerable heights, and also
in deep valleys; and we also meet with small masses
as well in the bottoms of valleys, as high up on the
mountains.</p>

<p>They occur sometimes in heaps, or dispersed in single
blocks; but these relations have no connection with their
magnitude, because we often find large and small masses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
in the same heap, and single, large, and small, blocks on
mountain summits, and in the bottoms of valleys. The
smaller blocks are more or less rounded, but seldom so
much so as the boulders of rivers, which have been exposed
to long continued friction. The larger blocks are
indeed angular, but not sharp edged. But in examining
this relation, we must carefully distinguish whether
or not the angles or edges are original, or have been produced
by subsequent, natural, or artificial causes. Very
often masses of this description are blasted with gunpowder,
either with the view of clearing the fields, or
of obtaining stones for building; and these, if left on
the ground, may lead into error.</p>

<p>These blocks vary in their nature, some being of the
primitive class, while others belong to those of the transition
and secondary classes. In general, they appertain
to rock formations, situated nearer to the central alpine
chains than those of the places where they are found.
Thus, no rocks of the transition class occur in gneiss valleys;
no alpine limestone in transition valleys; and, in
general, nowhere but in Jura, do blocks of Jura limestone
make their appearance. Therefore, all the loose
blocks of rocks between the Jura and the Alps, belong to
the strata of the high chains of the Alps.</p>

<p>But these blocks have different characters in different
districts. The loose blocks which occur in the river basin
of the Rhone, and the Lake of Geneva, are quite different
from those which lie strewed about in the river
basin of the Rhine. These, again, are equally different
from the loose blocks of the river basin of the Aare, as
those of the Aare are from the blocks of the Lake of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
Zurich, and the valley of Limmat; and these in their
turn are equally well distinguished from the great accumulations
in the valley of the Reuss. It rarely happens
that intermixtures take place among these different accumulations
of debris, and this is a circumstance which must
be attended to in our investigation.</p>

<p>It results from an accurate comparison of these loose
blocks with those mountain rocks which occur in extensive
chains in the high Alps; that the loose blocks of
every known river basin agree with the rocks which form
the sides of the upper parts of those high Alpine valleys,
which are in immediate connection with these great water
basins. Thus the loose blocks of the water basin of the
Rhine are similar to the rocks of Bundten. We find in
the Lake of Zurich, and in the Limmat valley, the rocks
of the Glarner land in loose blocks. The debris in the
basin of the Reuss consists of rocks of the mountains from
which the Reuss takes its rise. The loose blocks of the
water basin of the Aare are similar to the mountain rocks
of the high Alps of Bern; and the loose blocks, found in
the course of the Rhone, occur in fixed rocks in the Vallais.</p>

<p>It thus appears that the loose blocks are by no means
irregularly dispersed over the great valley between the
Alps and the Jura, but are distributed in the direction of
distinct water basins. It also appears, that the loose
blocks are not irregularly distributed in these different
basins; on the contrary, that, in some parts of the basin,
they are accumulated in great numbers; in other places
they are rare, and in some situations none occur.</p>

<p>From the preceding observations, we may obtain some
hints of importance in respect of the cause of this remark<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>able
phenomenon. These loose blocks already occur in
the alpine valleys, which open into the great valley, between
the Alps and the Jura. They are found more
abundantly in the wide parts of valleys immediately below
the narrow or contracted passes, and few occur in the
narrow, steep, and rocky parts of the valleys.</p>

<p>Loose blocks are found, at a greater or less height, in
the smaller lateral valleys that open into the transverse
alpine valleys, which terminate in the great valley between
the Alps and the Jura. If these lateral valleys form passes
(which lead over into other valleys by a lowering of
the high mountain chain), which are not more than 4000
feet above the level of the sea, loose blocks occur, not
only in these passes, but also more or less widely distributed
in the opposite valleys. In the great principal valley
which stretches between the Alps and the Jura, from
the Lake of Geneva to beyond the Lake Constance, we
find these loose blocks dispersed over all the hills whose
elevation is not more than 3000 feet above the level of
the sea; but even here the distribution of the blocks is
not entirely irregular. The largest are found on such
hills and acclivities as are opposite the mouths of the alpine
valleys, in the great principal valley. The blocks
are frequently found higher on such acclivities, than on
the sides of those valleys which may be considered as a
continuation of the alpine valleys. The loose blocks are
found every where on that acclivity of the Jura range
which is opposite to the Alps, and they are found highest
and largest in those places which are directly opposite the
mouths of the alpine valleys. In such places, the blocks
again attain an elevation of nearly 4000 feet above the
level of the sea; whereas, in the intermediate places,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
which are most remote from the places opposite the
mouths of the alpine valleys, the blocks seldom reach at
a height of 2000 feet above the level of the sea.</p>

<p>In those places where the Jura chain branches into the
great valley between the Jura and the Alps, loose blocks
are found in the valleys behind the projecting chains.
The Jura range is sometimes intersected in places opposite
to the Alps; and it is remarked, that loose blocks are
met with in the valleys behind these intersected portions
of the range; and that, when loose blocks occur in the
Jura range, at a distance from the Alps, it is only in such
places as are directly opposite to the intersected portions
of the chain opposite to the Alps.</p>

<p>The circumstance of the non-occurrence of these blocks
in the sandstone, marl, and nagelfluh, which occupy
the great valley between the Alps and the Jura, proves
that that revolution of our globe, by which these were
dispersed, took place after the formation of these rocks,
and may therefore have belonged to one of the latest
changes which have contributed to the present form of
the earth’s surface.</p>

<p>When we compare the relations of the alluvium of the
rivers in valleys with those of the loose blocks, their similarity
must strike every one. Thus, rolled masses are seldom
deposited in those places where a river forces its way
through a narrow passage; but where an expansion takes
place, owing to the distance of the banks increasing, the
rolled masses are sometimes accumulated in whole banks.
The same loose blocks seldom occur in the narrow
passages of the transverse valleys in the Alps; but as
soon as widenings of the valleys take place below these
narrowings, the blocks occur in abundance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span></p>

<p>If, during a flood, a rupture takes place in the banks
of a river, where it is contracted, a part of the stream
will flow out by the lateral opening, and carry along with
it rolled masses, even when the opening in the bank does
not reach to the bottom of the bed of the river; for the
mountain stream, loaded with boulders, carries them not
merely in single masses along its bottom, but the flood-water
of the stream generally attacks large sandbanks,
or older beds of rolled masses, and carries along with it,
accompanied with a terrible noise, whole masses, forces
them over the lower banks, or through the chasm in the
bank, and often deposites them several feet high, on an
immediately succeeding widening of the river’s course.</p>

<p>In the same manner, we observe loose blocks deposited
on high situations in the lateral valleys of the great
transverse valleys, and dispersed over the passes into the
neighbouring valleys. The height of the lateral deposites
of loose blocks, and their position in the passes, and
their passing into neighbouring valleys, are facts which
assist us in judging of the extent of the power that may
have acted during their transportation.</p>

<p>The striking agreement observable in the phenomena
of the distribution of the loose blocks from the interior
Alpine valleys to the interior valleys of the Jura, with
those in the rolled masses carried along by rivers, must
lead every one, who reflects on this interesting phenomenon,
to the hypothesis, that these blocks may have
been deposited in their present situations by an overwhelming
flood, which burst from the Alps. It is true that this
opinion is liable to many objections; but still it contains
a more plausible explanation of the phenomenon than
any other with which we are acquainted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span></p>

<p>The loose blocks, in the different river-districts, being
in general separated from each other, or if any intermixture
takes place of the rolled masses of one valley with
that of another, it being only on their edges, it is highly
probable that the floods which burst from these valleys,
and carried along with them the masses of rocks, may
have been simultaneous, by which the flow of the one basin
would bound and limit that of the other, and thus
prevent the water-flood of one basin flowing into the
neighbouring ones.</p>

<p>The contemporaneous occurrence of these different
floods from the Alpine valleys, can alone, on this hypothesis,
explain why this aqueous flood was so generally
and so highly accumulated in the great valleys between
the Alps and the Jura, as to reach the height of most of
the sandstone mountains, and to a great elevation in the
Jura, where many blocks are found deposited. But if
the contemporaneous occurrence of these floods is proved
by the facts already enumerated, to what cause are we
to refer this simultaneous bursting of floods of water
from so many Alpine valleys?</p>

<p>We observe, on the north-western side of the chain of
the Alps, numerous openings, which, by their structure,
seem to point out the action of violent floods. Let us
suppose the numerous valleys, in the districts already
described, closed at their present entrances, or openings,
as would seem from their structure to have been formerly
the case; the consequence of this arrangement
would be the filling of the Alpine valleys with water, to
the height of the lowest passes among the mountains,
and thus an enormous accumulation of water would take
place. This great body of water, if let loose at once,
by the bursting of the lower extremities of the valleys,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
would form a flood which would sweep across the sandstone
mountains, between the Alps and the Jura range,
and even ascend high on the Jura itself. This flood of
water, moving, probably, at the rate of 200 feet in a second,
and loaded with debris of rocks, would carry
masses, even these having a magnitude of 50,000 cubical
feet, some thousand feet high, on the Jura range<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>.
Geologists maintain, that the blocks or boulders met with
in other countries, and arranged as those in Switzerland,
have been deposited where we now find them, by the
bursting of lakes; while those found on the shores of the
Baltic, are conjectured to have been transported by a
great rush of water caused by the sudden elevation of the
land of Scandinavia. Another opinion has its advocates,
which maintains that these boulders have been spread over
different countries by the waters of the <em>deluge</em>.</p>

<h3 class="fs70">ON THE ALLUVIAL LAND OF THE DANISH ISLANDS IN
THE BALTIC, AND ON THE COAST OF SLESWIGH.</h3>

<p>In this section, Cuvier gives a clear and distinct account
of several kinds of alluvial formations. M. De
Luc, in the first volume of his Geological Travels, describes
the alluvial formations that cover and bound
many of the islands in the Baltic, and upon the coast of
Denmark, and gives so interesting an account of the
modes followed by the inhabitants, in preserving these
alluvial deposites, that we feel pleasure in communicating
it to our readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“During my stay at Husum, I had the advantage of
passing my evenings very agreeably and profitably at
the house of M. Hartz, with his own family, and two
Danish officers, Major Behmann, commandant at Husum,
and Captain Baron de Barackow. The conversation
often turned on the objects of my excursions, and
particularly on the natural history of the <em>coasts</em> and of
the <em>islands</em>; respecting which, M. Hartz obligingly undertook
to give me extracts from the chronicles of the
country. This led us to speak of the Danish islands;
and those officers giving me such descriptions of them,
as were very interesting to my object, I begged their
permission to write down, in their presence, the principal
circumstances which they communicated to me. These
will form the first addition to my own observations; I
shall afterwards proceed to the information which I obtained
from M. Hartz.</p>

<p>The two principal islands of the Danish Archipelago,
those of Funen and Seeland (or Zeeland), as well as some
small islands in the Kattegate, namely, Lenoe, Anholt,
and Samsoe, are hilly, and principally composed of
<em>geest</em><a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>; and in these are found <em>gravel</em> and <em>blocks of granite</em>,
and of other stones of that class, exactly in the same
manner as in the country which I have lately described,
and its <em>islands</em> in the North Sea. On the borders of the
two first of these Danish islands, there are also <em>blocks</em> in
the sea; but only in front of <em>abrupt</em> coasts, as is the case
with the islands of Poel and Rugen, and along the coasts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
of the Baltic. The lands added to these islands of <em>geest</em>
are in most part composed of the <em>sand</em> of the sea, the
land-waters there being very inconsiderable; and to the
south of them have been formed several islands of the
same nature, the chief of which are Laland and Falster,
near Seeland. These, like the marsh islands in the North
Sea, are sand-banks accumulated by the waves, and,
when covered with grass, continuing to be farther raised
by the sediments deposited between its blades. In the
Baltic, where there are no sensible tides, such islands
may be inhabited without dikes, as well as the extensions
of the coasts; because, being raised to the highest level
of that sea, while their declivity under water is very
small, and being also more firm in their composition, the
waves die away on their shores; and if, in any extraordinary
case, the sea rises over them, it leaves on them
fresh deposits, which increase their heights. These soils
are all perfectly <em>horizontal</em>, like those added to the coasts
of the Continent.</p>

<p>Some of these islands approach entirely, or in part,
to the nature of that of Rugen. This island of Seeland,
on that side which is called Hedding, has a promontory
composed of strata of <em>chalk</em> with its flints. The island of
Moen (or Mona), on the south of the latter, has a similar
promontory near Maglebye and Mandemark; and the
island of Bornholm, the easternmost of those belonging
to Denmark, contains strata of <em>coal</em>, covered by others
of <em>sandstone</em>. Phenomena like these, evident symptoms
of the most violent catastrophes at the bottom of the ancient
sea, proceeding, as I think I have clearly shewn,
from the subsidence and angular motions of large masses
of strata, which must have forced out the interior fluids
with the utmost impetuosity, it is not surprising that so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
many fragments of the lowermost strata are found dispersed
over this great theatre of ruins.</p>

<p>I now proceed to the details which I received from
M. Hartz; beginning by a specific designation of the
<em>islands</em> dependent on the province of Sleswigh, such as
they are at present, belonging to the three classes already
defined. To commence from the north; Fanoe, Rom,
Sylt, and Amrom, were originally <em>islands</em> of the same nature
as the neighbouring continent, but have been since
extended by <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i><a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>. The soil of these islands, with
its gravel and blocks of primordial stones, was at first
barren, as the <em>geest</em> is naturally every where; but is become
fertile by manure, of which there has been no deficiency,
since those grounds have been surrounded with
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsch</i>, where the cattle are kept in stables during the
winter. In the island of Sylt, there are spaces consisting
of <em>moor</em>, but its head of land, which extends on the
south as far as Mornum, is composed entirely of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsch</i>,
and is bordered with <em>dunes</em> towards the open sea, because,
the sediments of the rivers not reaching any farther,
the <em>sea-sand</em> impelled against it by the waves remains
pure, and is thus raised by the winds in hillocks
on the shore. The shallow bottom of the sea, between
this island and that of Fora, is of <em>geest</em>: at low water, it
may be passed over on foot; and there are found on it
gravel and blocks of <em>granite</em>. But on the same side of
Fora there is a great extent of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsch</i>, beginning from
St Laurencius. Among the islands consisting entirely of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsch</i> and surrounded with dikes, the most considerable
are Pellworm and Nord Strand; and among the Halligs,
or those inhabited without dikes, the chief are Olant,
Nord-marsh, Langne, Groode, and Hooge.</p>

<p>Such are the islands on this coast, in their present
state, now rendered permanent by the degree of perfection
at which the art of dike-making is arrived. But, in
former times, though the <em>original</em> land was never attacked
by the <em>sea</em>, which, by adding to it <em>new lands</em>, soon
formed a barrier against its own encroachments, the latter,
and the <em>islands</em> composed of the same materials, were
subject to great and sudden changes, very fatal to those
who were engaged to settle on them by the richness of
their soil, comparatively with the continental. The inhabitants,
who continued to multiply on them during several
generations, were taught, indeed, by experience, that
they might at last be invaded by the element which was
incessantly threatening them; but having as yet no knowledge
of natural causes, they blindly considered those
that endangered them as supernatural, and for a long
time used no precautions for their own security. They
were ignorant of the dreadful effects of a certain association
of circumstances, rare indeed, but, when occurring,
absolutely destructive of these <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i>. This association
consists of an extraordinary elevation of the level of
the North Sea, from the long continuance of certain
winds in the Atlantic, with a violent storm occurring
during the tides of the new or full moon; for then the
sea rises above the level of all the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i>; and before
they were secured against such attacks, the waves rolling
over them, and tearing away the grass which had bound
their surface, they were reduced to the state of mere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
banks of sand and mud, whence they had been drawn,
by the long course of ordinary causes. Such were the
dreadful accidents to which the first settlers on these
lands were exposed; but no sooner were they over, than
ordinary causes began again to act; the sand-banks rose;
their surface was covered with grass; the coast was thus
extended, and new islands were formed; time effaced the
impression of past misfortunes; and those among the
inhabitants of these dangerous soils, who had been able
to save themselves on the coast, ventured to return to
settle on them again, and had time to multiply, before
the recurrence of the same catastrophes.</p>

<p>This has been the general course of events on all the
coasts of the North Sea, and particularly on those of
the countries of Sleswigh and Holstein. It is thus that
the origin and progress of the <em>art of dikes</em> will supply us
with a very interesting <em>chronometer</em> in the history of the
continent and of man, particularly exemplified in this
part of the globe. A Lutheran clergyman, settled in the
island of Nord Strand, having collected all the particulars
of this history which the documents of the country
could afford, published it in 1668, in a German work,
entitled <cite>The North Frisian Chronicle</cite>. It was chiefly
from this work, and from the <cite>Chronicle of Dankwerth</cite>,
that M. Hartz extracted the information which he gave
to me, accompanied by two maps, copied for me, by
one of his sons, from those of Johannes Mayerus, a mathematician;
they bear the title of <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Frisia Cimbrica</cite>; one
of them respecting the state of the <em>islands</em> and of the
<em>coast</em>, in 1240, as it may be traced in the chronicles, and
the other, as it was in 1651.</p>

<p>According to these documents, the first inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
of the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i> were <em>Frisii</em> or <em>Frisians</em>, designated also
under the names of <em>Cimbri</em> and <em>Sicambri</em>: the latter
name, M. Hartz conjectures, might come from the ancient
German words <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Seekampfers</i>, i. e. <em>Sea-warriors</em>; the
<em>Frisians</em> being very warlike. These people appear to
have had the same origin with those, who, at a rather
earlier period, took possession of the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i> of Ost-Frise
(East-Friesland), and of that Friesland which
forms one of the United Provinces; but this common
origin <ins class="corr" id="tn-360" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'is very obsure'">
is very obscure</ins>. Even at the present day, the
inhabitants of the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i>, from near Husum to Tondern,
or Tunder to the North, though themselves unacquainted
with it, speak a language which the other
inhabitants of the country do not understand, and which
is supposed to be Frisian. It is the same at a village
in the peninsula of Bremen, by which I have had occasion
to pass.</p>

<p>The <em>Sicambri</em> or <em>North Frisians</em>, are traced back to
some centuries before the Christian era. At the commencement
of that era, they were attacked by Frotho,
King of Denmark, and lost a battle, under their king
Vicho, near the river Hever. Four centuries afterwards
they joined the troops of Hengist and Horsa. In the
year 692, their king Radebot resided in the island of
Heiligeland. Charles Martel subdued them in 732; and
some time afterwards they joined Charlemagne against
Gottric, King of Denmark. These are some of the circumstances
of the history of this Frisian colony, recorded
in the chronicles of which I have spoken; but the history
here interesting to us is that of the lands whereon
they settled.</p>

<p>It appears that these people did not arrive here in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
one body, but successively, in the course of many years:
they spread themselves over various parts of the coasts
of the North Sea, and even a considerable way up the
borders of the Weser and the Elbe; according to documents
which I have mentioned in my <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><ins class="corr" id="tn-361" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Letters sur l’Histoire'">
Lettres sur l’Histoire</ins>
de la Terre et de l’Homme</cite>. These new settlers
found large <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i>, formed, as well in the wide mouths
of those rivers as along the coasts, and around the original
islands of <em>geest</em>; especially that of Heiligeland, the
most distant from the coast, and opposite the mouth of
the Eyder. Of this island, which is steep towards the
south, the original mass consists of strata of <em>sandstone</em>;
and at that time its <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsch</i> extended almost to Eyderstede:
there were <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i> likewise around all the other
original islands; besides very large islands of pure <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsch</i>
in the intervals of the former.</p>

<p>All these lands were desert at the arrival of the Frisians;
and the parts on which they established their first
habitations, to take care of their breeds of horses and
cattle feeding on the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i>, were the original eminences
of the islands; on that of Heiligeland they built
a temple to their great goddess Phoseta, or Fosta.
When they became too numerous to confine themselves
to the heights, their herds being also greatly multiplied,
they ventured to begin inhabiting the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i>; but
afterwards, some great inundations having shewn them
the dangers of that situation, they adopted the practice
followed by those who had settled on the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i> of the
province of Groningen, and still continued on the Halligs;
that of raising artificial mounts called <em>werfs</em>, on
which they built their houses, and whither they could,
upon occasion, withdraw their herds; and it likewise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
appears, that, in the winter, they assembled in greater
numbers on the spots originally the highest, in the islands,
as well as on some parts of the coasts.</p>

<p>Things continued in this state for several centuries;
during which period, it is probable that the inhabitants
of these lands were often, by various catastrophes, disturbed
in the enjoyment of them, though not discouraged.
But in 516, by which time these people were become
very numerous, more than 600 of them perished
by one of the concurrences of fatal circumstances already
defined. It was then that they undertook the astonishing
enterprise of enclosing these lands. They
dug ditches around all the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i>, heaping up on their
exterior edge the earth which was taken out; and thus
they opposed to the sea, dikes of eight feet in height.
After this, comprehending that nothing could contribute
more to the safety of their dwellings, than to remove
the sea to a greater distance, they undertook,
with that view, to exclude it from the intervals between
the islands, by uniting, as far as should be possible,
those islands with each other. I will describe the process
by which they effected this, after I shall have recalled
to attention some circumstances leading to it.</p>

<p>From all that I have already said of the <em>fore-lands</em>,
and of the manner in which they are increased, it may
be understood, that the common effects of the <em>waves</em>
and of the <em>tides</em> is to bring materials from the bottom of
the sea towards the coasts; and that the process continues
in every state of the sea. The land winds produce
no <em>waves</em> on the coasts, which can carry back to
the bottom of the sea what has been brought thence by
the winds blowing against the shore; and as for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
<em>tides</em>, it may have been already comprehended (and
shall soon be proved), that the <em>ebb</em> carries back but very
little of what has been brought by the <em>flood</em>. So that,
but for some extraordinary circumstances, the materials
continually impelled towards the shore, which first form
islands, would at last unite against the coast in a continuous
soil. The rare events, productive of great catastrophes,
do not carry back these materials towards the
bottom of the sea; they only, as it has been said before,
ravage the surface, diminishing the heights, and destroying
the effect of vegetation. These, then, were the effects
against which it was necessary to guard.</p>

<p>I now come to the plan of uniting the <em>islands</em>, formed
by these early inhabitants. They availed themselves
for that purpose of all such parts of the sand-banks as
lay in the intervals between the large islands, and were
beginning to produce grass. These, when surrounded
with dikes, are what are called <em>Hoogs</em>; and their effects
are to break the waves, thus diminishing their action
against the dikes of the large islands, and, at the same
time, to determine the accumulation of the mud in the
intervals between those islands. In this manner a large
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsch</i> island, named Everschop, was already, in 987,
united to Eyderstede by the point on which Poppenbull
is situated; and in 995, the union of the same <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i>
was effected by another point, namely, that of Tetenbull.
Lastly, in the year 1000, Eyderstede received a new increase
by the course of the Hever, prolonged between
the sand banks, being fixed by a dike; but the whole
still remained an <em>island</em>. This is an example of the
manner in which the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsch</i> islands were united by the
<em>hoogs</em>; and the chronicle of the country says, that, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
these labours, the islands were so considerably enlarged
in size, and the intervals between them so much raised,
that, at low water, it was possible to pass on foot from
one to the other. The extent of these <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i> was so
great on the coast of Sleswigh alone, that they were divided
into three provinces, two of which comprehended
the islands, and the third comprised the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i> contiguous
to the coast; and the same works were carried on
upon the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i> of the coast of Holstein.</p>

<p>But the grounds thus gained from the sand-banks
were very insecure; these people, though they had inhabited
them more than ten centuries, had not yet understood
the possibility of that combination of fatal circumstances
above described, against which their dikes
formed but a very feeble rampart; the North Sea, by
the extraordinary elevations of its level, being much
more formidable in this respect than the ocean, where
the changes of absolute level are much less considerable.
I shall give an abridged account of the particulars extracted
by M. Hartz from the chronicle of Dankwerth,
relative to the great catastrophes which these <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i>
successively underwent, previously to the time when experience
led to the means necessary for their security.</p>

<p>In 1075, the island of Nord Strand, then contiguous
to the coast, particularly experienced the effect of that
unusual combination of destructive causes; the sea passing
over its dike, and forming within it large excavations
like lakes. In 1114 and 1158, considerable parts
of Eyderstede were carried away; and in 1204, the part
called Sudhever in the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsch</i> of Uthholm was destroyed.
All these catastrophes were fatal to many of the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsch</i>
settlers; but in 1216, the sea having risen so high that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
its waves passed over Nord Strand, Eyderstede, and Ditmarsch,
near 10,000 of their inhabitants perished. Again,
in 1300, seven parishes in Nord Strand and Pellworm
were destroyed; and in 1338, Ditmarsch experienced a
new catastrophe, which swept away a great part of it on
the side next Eyderstede: the dike of the course of the
Eyder between the sand-banks was demolished, and the
tides have ever since preserved their course throughout
that wide space. Lastly, in the year 1362, the isles of
Fora and Sylt, then forming but one, were divided, and
Nord Strand, then a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsch</i> united to the coast, was separated
from it.</p>

<p>During a long time, the inhabitants who survived
these catastrophes, and their successors, were so much
discouraged, that they attempted nothing more than to
surround with <em>dikes</em> like the former such spaces of their
meadow-land as appeared the least exposed to these ravages,
leaving the rest to its fate. But the common
course of causes continually tending to extend and to
raise the grassy parts of the sand-banks, and no extraordinary
combination of circumstances having interrupted
these natural operations, later generations, farther
advanced in the arts, undertook to secure to themselves
the possession of those new grounds. In 1525, they
turned their attention to the indentations made, during
the preceding catastrophes, in the borders of the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i>;
the waves, confined in these narrow spaces, sometimes
threatening to cut their way into the interior part. In
the front of all the creeks of this kind they planted
stakes, which they interlaced with osiers, leaving a certain
space between the lines. The waves, thus broken,
could no longer do injury to the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsch</i>; and their se<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>diments
being deposited on both sides of this open
fence, very solid <em>fore-lands</em> were there formed. In 1550,
they raised the <em>dikes</em> considerably higher, employing
wheelbarrows, the use of which was only then introduced.
For this purpose, they much enlarged and deepened
the interior canals, in order to obtain more earth, not
merely to add to the height of the dikes, but to extend
their base on the outer side. At last they began to
cover these dikes with straw-ropes; but this great preservative
of dikes was at first ill managed; and the use
of it was so slowly spread, that it was not adopted in
North Strand and in Eyderstede, till about the years
1610 and 1612.</p>

<p>Before that time, however, the safety of the extensive
soil of the latter <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsch</i> had been provided for in a
different manner. I have said above, that, when the
isles of Everschop and Utholm had been united to it,
the whole together still formed but one large <em>island</em>;
now, in this state, it was in as great danger on the side
towards the continent, as on that open to the sea; because
two small rivers, the Trene and the Nord Eyder,
discharging themselves into the interval between it and
the land, and by preserving their course to the sea,
this interval was thus kept open to tempest, sometimes
from the side of the Hever, sometimes from that of the
Eyder; and the waves, beating against the <em>geest</em>, were
thence repelled upon the <em>marsch</em>. The inhabitants,
seeing that the expence of remedying these evils would
be greater than they could afford, while at the same
time it was indispensable to their safety, addressed themselves
to their bishop and to their prefect, of whom they
requested pecuniary assistance; and having obtained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
it they first undertook the great enterprise of carrying
the Trene and the Nord Eyder higher up into the Eyder;
keeping their waters, however, still separate for a
certain space, by a <em>dam</em> with a <em>sluice</em>, in order to form
there a reservoir of fresh water; the tides ascending up
the Eyder above Frederickstadt. They were thus enabled
to carry on the extremities of the <em>dike</em> on both
sides to join the <em>geest</em>; and the interval between the latter
and the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsch</i> was then soon filled up, there being
only left at their junction the canal above described
which receives the water of the <em>geest</em>, and, at low water,
discharges them from both its extremities by sluices.
At the same time, the <ins class="corr" id="tn-367" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'islands of Pelworm'">
islands of Pellworm</ins> and Nord
Strand were united with each other by means of eight
<em>hoogs</em>; and the <em>sandy marsches</em> of which I have spoken,
contiguous to the <em>geest</em>, on the north of that of Husum,
were inclosed with dikes.</p>

<p>After the dikes had been thus elevated, and their
surface rendered firm by the straw ropes, though the latter
were not yet properly fixed, the inhabitants of the
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i> for some time enjoyed repose; but on the 11th
October 1634, the sea, rising to an excessive height, carried
away, during a great tempest, the <em>hoogs</em> which had
produced the junction between Pellworm and Nord
Strand, these having ever since continued distinct islands;
it also violently attacked Ditmarsch; and its ravages extended
over the whole coast, as far as the very extensive
new lands of Jutland. Princes then came forward zealously
to the relief of their subjects. In particular, Frederick
III., Duke of Sleswigh, seeing that the inhabitants
of Nord Strand were deficient both in the talents and
in the means necessary for the reparation and future se<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>curity
of that large island, and knowing that the art of
dikes had made greater progress in Holland, because
of the opulence of the country, addressed himself to the
States-General, requesting them to send him an engineer
of dikes, with workmen accustomed to repair them;
and this was granted. The dikes of Nord Strand were
then repaired in the most solid manner; and the Dutch
engineer, seeing the fertility of its soil, advised his sons
upon his death-bed, to purchase lands and settle there,
if the Duke would grant them the free exercise of their
religion; they being Jansenist catholics, and the inhabitants
of the island Lutherans. The Duke agreed to
this, on condition that they and their posterity should
continue to superintend the works carried on upon the
dikes; to which they engaged themselves. From that
time the art of dikes, and particularly that part of it which
consists in covering them solidly with straw, has become
common to all the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">marsches</i>; and the Dutch families,
which have contributed to this fortunate change,
continue to inhabit the same island, and to enjoy the
free exercise of their religion.”</p></div>

<h3 class="fs70">ON THE SAND-FLOOD.</h3>

<p>In different parts of Scotland, as in Aberdeenshire,
Hebrides, and Shetland Islands, there are examples of
the natural chronometer mentioned in the text. In
Morayshire there is a striking example of the sand-flood,
concerning which the following details have been furnished
by my young friend the Rev. Mr Ritchie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span></p>


<h4><em>Sand-Flood in Morayshire.</em></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Westward from the mouth of the river Findhorn in
Morayshire, a district, consisting of upwards of ten square
miles of land, which, owing to its extreme fertility, was
once termed the Granary of Moray, has been depopulated
and rendered utterly unproductive by the sand-flood.
This barren waste may be characterised as hilly;
the accumulations of sand composing these hills frequently
varying in their height, and changing their situation.</p>

<p>There is historical evidence, that, in the year 1097,
the Moray Firth overflowed the low country on its southern
shore, and threw out sand. But the destruction of
the barony of Coubine (which includes the greater part
of the desert mentioned above) was long subsequent to
this, as might be proved from the inscription on a tombstone
in the church yard of Dyke. From historical notices,
also, in regard to the Kinnairds of Coubine, preparing
for publication, it appears that the eruption of
sand commenced about the year 1677; that its progress
was gradual; that, in 1697, not a vestige was to be seen
of the manor-place, orchards, and offices of Coubine;
that two-thirds of the barony were already ruined, and
that the sand was daily gaining ground.</p>

<p>This sand, which overwhelmed Coubine, came from
Mavieston, situated on the shore, about seven miles west
from the mouth of the Findhorn, where, from time immemorial,
there have been large accumulations of sand.
The sands at Mavieston had formerly been covered with
vegetation. In an act of the Scottish Parliament, dated
16th July 1695, for the preservation of lands adjacent
to sand-hills, it is stated, that the destruction of Cou<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>bine
“was occasioned by the bad practice of pulling bent
and juniper.” Having been thus set at liberty, the sand
moved towards the north-east, as appears from the desolation
which marks its progress. The moving cause is
the wind. I have had opportunities of witnessing the
effect of the wind on the loose sand. When the breeze
is moderate it carries along with it successive waves of
sand, each wave (if I may be allowed the expression)
being of a small size, and moving with greater or less
velocity, in proportion to the strength of the breeze, and
presenting a very beautiful appearance. When the wind
is high the heavier particles are drifted forwards, the
more minute are raised to a considerable height in the
atmosphere, occasioning no small inconvenience to the
spectator, who finds his ears and nostrils filled with sand.
The movements of the sand are still towards the north-east.
In the winter of 1816 a large portion of Binsness,
the only remaining farm on the west side of the Findhorn,
situated in the line of the sand’s progress, was overwhelmed.
Since that period large accumulations of sand
have disappeared altogether, and rich soil, marked with
the plough, has been left bare, after having been buried
for upwards of a century.</p>

<p>The very minute particles, which, as has been stated,
the wind raises to a considerable height, are occasionally
carried across the Bay of Findhorn. In the statistical
account of Dyke, the parish in which Coubine is situated,
it is said, “that, at the town of Findern, in a blowing
day, one may feel the sand sharply striking on his face,
from the west side.” This sand, of extreme fineness, is to
be seen in and around the town of Findhorn, and along
the coast much rich land is said to have been covered by
sand brought from the west.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span></p>

<p>The greater quantity of the sand is drifted into the
river, and its effects have been very remarkable. Many
years ago the mouth of the river having become blocked
up with sand, it cut out for itself its present channel,
which conducts it, by a more direct course, to the sea.
In consequence of this, the old town of Findhorn had
changed its situation, from the east to the west side of
the river, and its site has since been covered by the sea.
Previous to this, however, the inhabitants, carrying with
them the stones of their former houses, had removed
across the river, and erected the present village. On the
retiring of the tide from the bay, the river almost disappears,
being swallowed up by the sand, and quick-sands
are formed. The effect resulting from the same cause,
the drifting in of the sand is very different at high water.
In consequence of the channel of the river having
been filled up, the bay has increased in breadth. The
sand constantly carried down by the river has formed a
bar, which prevents the entrance of large vessels; and
the river, probably owing to its increased breadth, and
this bar depriving it of the impetus acquired in the course
of its descent, is, at spring-tides, unable to force its way
into the sea, when it is made to flow back, and inundate
a considerable extent of carse-land situated at the head
of the bay. It was at one time proposed to render the
river navigable by dredging. And it is proposed to endeavour
to save the adjoining carse-land, which is of the
richest quality, from the monthly inundation to which it
is at present subject, by building a wall along the river
side.</p>

<p>I venture to suggest, that the plan Nature employs for
fettering down sand should first be imitated, and that
seeds of the Arundo arenaria, Elymus arenarius, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
other plants, which grow readily in sand, should be, from
time to time, strewed over the Mavieston Hills. The
seeds of the Arundo arenaria are not always to be had;
but plants might easily be procured in abundance, and
be dibbled into the sand-hills. The circumstance of great
accumulations of sand having of late disappeared from
Coubine, has given rise to the expectation, that the barony
is at no distant period to become again serviceable
to man. By cutting off fresh supplies from Mavieston,
this period would be accelerated, and the proposed improvements
rendered comparatively easy.</p>

<p>There is at present little bent on Coubine. It is
chiefly confined to a range of knolls, which forms the
southern boundary of the sand, and protects the adjoining
cultivated fields from its encroachments; and yet,
notwithstanding the terrible calamity the inhabitants of
Moray brought upon themselves, by the pulling of bent,
this “bad practice” still prevails; this plant being in no
other district of country which I have visited so generally
employed for thatching cottars’ houses, and other
economical purposes.”</p></div>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>In the Outer Hebrides the effects of the sand-flood are
also considerable, as shewn in the following notice communicated
by my intelligent assistant Mr Macgillivray.</p>


<h4><em>Sand-Flood in the Hebrides, and other parts of Scotland.</em></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The bottom of the sea, along the whole west coast of
the Outer Hebrides, from Barray Head to the Butt of
the Lewis, appears to consist of sand. Along the shores
of these islands this sand appears here and there, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
patches of several miles, separated by intervals of rock,
of equal or greater extent. In some places the sandy
shores are flat, or very gently sloping, forming what are
here called Fords; in others, behind the beach, there is
an accumulation of sand to the height of from twenty to
sixty feet, formed into hillocks. This sand is constantly
drifting; and in several places islands have been formed
by the removal of isthmi. The parts immediately
behind the beach are also liable to be inundated by the
sand; and in this manner most of the islands have suffered
very considerable damage. Those of Pabbay and
Berneray in Harris may be particularised; in the former
of which, a tract of about a mile and a-half long, by half
a mile in breadth, has been converted into a desert of
drifting sand; and in the latter a large plain, that was
formerly noted for its fertility, has been entirely swept
away. The sand consists almost entirely of comminuted
shells, apparently of the species which are found in the
neighbouring seas. It is rather coarse in the grain; but,
during high winds, by the rubbing of its particles upon
each other, a sort of dust is formed, which, at a distance,
resembles smoke, and which, in the Island of Berneray,
I have seen driven into the sea, to the distance of upwards
of two miles, appearing like a thin white fog. The
cure of sand drift has been attempted in these islands in
two different ways. Mr Alexander Macleod, surgeon of
North Uist, is the inventor of the most efficacious method,
which is that of cutting thin square turfs from the neighbouring
pasture grounds, and laying them down at intervals
of some inches. In the course of a very few years the
turfs coalesce, and the stript ground is little the worse; for
the roots remaining in it, a new vegetation rapidly springs
up. The other method was introduced by Mr Macleod<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
of Harris, and tried extensively upon his estate. It consists
of planting small bundles of Arundo arenaria, at
distances of about a foot and a-half. These take root,
and prevent the drifting to a certain degree. But often
vegetation is tardy in establishing itself, and if the turf
plan be not considerably more expensive, it seems preferable,
because it very effectually prevents the drift,
and moreover, produces excellent pasture ground; the
former of which indications, the planting system, does
not completely effect, and the latter in a very imperfect
degree.”</p></div>

<p>We may add, as this subject is a very interesting
one, that further details, in regard to the moving sands
of Scotland, will be found, on consulting the Statistical
Account of Scotland, vol. xx. p. 220. In the Appendix
to the Account of the parish of Dyke, vol. xx. p. 228.
<em>et seq.</em> there is an account of the Sand-Hills <ins class="corr" id="tn-374" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'of Maviston'">
of Mavieston</ins>, which overwhelmed the barony of Coubine, as mentioned
in Mr Ritchie’s communication. In vol. xix. p. 622.
is a notice of the shifting of two hills of the Mavieston
Range 500 yards in twenty years. In vol. xxi.
p. 207. is a notice of some hundred acres in Duffus’ parish
covered three feet deep by drift sand; fourteen inches
accumulating in one night. In Neill’s Tour in Orkney
and Shetland 1804, it is observed, that, in the neighbourhood
of the Castle of Noltland, in Westra, much havoc has
been done by the blowing of the sand. No measures are
there employed for putting a stop to this kind of devastation.
In the 6th volume of the Highland Society’s
Transactions will be found a report of the operations carried
on in Harris, and alluded to in Mr Macgillivray’s
communication. And in Dr Walker’s Account of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
Hebrides, and Mr Macdonald’s Work on the Hebrides,
farther details may be seen. In Jameson’s Account of the
Shetland Islands, and in Shirreff and Fleming’s Reports on
these islands, are also facts connected with this devastating
agent. We may add, that Dr Oudney, Major Denham,
and Captain Clapperton, have added to our knowledge
of the blowing sands of the African deserts. The
coloured engraving of the sand-hills of the African Desert
in Denham, Oudney and Clapperton’s Narrative, is
a striking and interesting representation of the form of
the moving sand-hills of Africa.</p>


<h4><em>The moving Sands of Africa and their effects are thus
described in the</em> <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mercure de France</span> <em>for September
1809, by De Luc</em>.</h4>

<p>The sands of the Lybian desert, he says, driven by
the west winds, have left no lands capable of tillage
on any parts of the western banks of the Nile not sheltered
by mountains. The encroachment of these sands
on soils which were formerly inhabited and cultivated is
evidently seen. M. Denon informs us, in the account
of his <cite>Travels in Lower and Upper Egypt</cite>, that summits
of the ruins of ancient cities buried under these sands still
appear externally; and that, but for a ridge of mountains
called the <em>Lybian chain</em>, which borders the left
bank of the Nile, and forms, in the parts where it rises,
a barrier against the invasion of these sands, the shores
of the river, on that side, would long since have ceased
to be habitable. Nothing can be more melancholy,
says this traveller, than to walk over villages swallowed
up by the sand of the desert, to trample under foot
their roofs, to strike against the summits of their mina<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>rets,
to reflect that yonder were cultivated fields, that
there grew trees, that here were even the dwellings of
men, and that all has vanished.</p>

<p>If, then, our continents were as ancient as has been
pretended, no traces of the habitation of men would appear
on any part of the western bank of the Nile, which
is exposed to this scourge of the sands of the desert. The
existence, therefore, of such monuments attests the successive
progress of the encroachments of the sand; and
those parts of the bank, formerly inhabited, will for ever
remain arid and waste. Thus the great population of
Egypt, announced by the vast and numerous ruins of its
cities, was in great part due to a cause of fertility which
no longer exists, and to which sufficient attention has
not been given. The sands of the desert were formerly
remote from Egypt; the <em>Oases</em>, or habitable spots, still
appearing in the midst of the sands, being the remains
of the soils formerly extending the whole way to the
Nile; but these sands, transported hither by the western
winds, have overwhelmed and buried this extensive tract,
and doomed to sterility a land which was once remarkable
for its fruitfulness.</p>

<p>It is therefore not solely to her revolutions and
changes of sovereigns that Egypt owes the loss of her
ancient splendour; it is also to her having been thus irrecoverably
deprived of a tract of land, by which, before
the sands of the desert had covered it, and caused it to
disappear, her wants had been abundantly supplied.
Now, if we fix our attention on this fact, and reflect on
the consequences which would have attended it if thousands,
or only some hundreds, of centuries had elapsed
since our continents first existed above the level of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
sea, does it not evidently appear that all the country on
the west of the Nile would have been buried under this
sand before the erection of the cities of ancient Egypt,
how remote soever that period may be supposed; and
that in a country so long afflicted with sterility, no idea
would even have been formed of constructing such vast
and numerous edifices? When these cities indeed were
built, another cause concurred in favouring their prosperity.
The navigation of the Red Sea was not then attended
with any danger on the coasts; all its ports, now nearly
blocked up with <em>reefs of coral</em>, had a safe and easy access;
the vessels laden with merchandize and provisions
could enter them and depart without risk of being wrecked
on these shoals, which have risen since that time, and
are still increasing in extent.</p>

<p>The defects of the present government of Egypt,
and the discovery of the passage from Europe to India
round the Cape of Good Hope, are therefore not the
only causes of the present state of decline of this country.
If the sands of the desert had not invaded the bordering
lands on the west, if the work of the sea polypi in
the Red Sea had not rendered dangerous the access to
its coasts and to its ports, and even filled up some of the
latter, the population of Egypt and the adjacent countries,
together with their product, would alone have sufficed
to maintain them in a state of prosperity and abundance.
But now, though the passage to India by the
Cape of Good Hope should cease to exist, though the
political advantages which Egypt enjoyed during the
brilliant period of Thebes and Memphis should be re-established,
she could never again attain the same degree
of splendour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span></p>

<p>Thus the reefs of coral which had been raised in the
Red Sea on the east of Egypt, and the sands of the desert
which invade it on the west, concur in attesting
this truth: That our continents are not of a more remote
antiquity than has been assigned to them by the
sacred historian in the book of Genesis, from the great
era of the deluge.</p>

<h3><em>Action of the Sea upon Coasts.</em></h3>

<p>The ocean, in its action upon the cliffs and banks situated
on the coast, breaks them down to a greater or
less extent, and either accumulates the debris at their
basis in the form of sea beaches of greater or less magnitude,
or by currents carries it away to be deposited
upon other shores, or to give rise to sand-banks near
the coast, which, in the course of time, become united to
the land, and thus secure it from the further action of
the sea. These <em>destroying</em> and <em>forming</em> effects of the
waters of the ocean are to be observed all around the
coasts of this island; and beautiful examples of such actions
are to be seen on the coasts of Ireland, and in
many of the islands that lie to the west and north of
<ins class="corr" id="tn-378" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Great Britian'">
Great Britain</ins>. In a paper read before the Wernerian
Natural History Society, Mr Stevenson, engineer, mentions
many facts illustrative of the destroying effects
of the ocean on our coasts.&mdash;Thus he informs us that
the waters of the sea are wearing away the land upon
both sides of the Frith of Forth, not only in exposed,
but also in sheltered situations, and the solid strata,
as well as the looser alluvial formations, which owe their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
origin to the destroying agency of the ocean at a former
period, are again yielding to its action. At Saint Andrew’s,
the famous castle of Cardinal Beaton, which is
said originally to have been some distance from the sea,
now almost overhangs it: From St Andrew’s northward
to Eden water and the River Tay, the coast presents a
sandy beach, and is so liable to shift, that it is difficult
to trace the change it may have undergone. It is certain,
however, that, within this last century, the sea has
made such an impression upon the <ins class="corr" id="tn-379" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'sands of Barrey'">
sands of Barray</ins>, on the northern side of the Tay, that the light-houses at
the entrance of the river, which were formerly erected
at the southern extremity of Button-ness, have been
from time to time removed about a mile and a quarter
further northward, on account of the wasting and shifting
of these sandy shores, and that the spot on which the
outer light-house stood in the 17th century, is now two
or three fathoms under water, and is at least three quarters
of a mile within flood-mark.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><a id="NOTE_32"></a>NOTE, <a href="#Page_32">p. 32.</a></p>

<h3><em>On the growth of Coral Islands.</em></h3>

<p>Of all the genera of lithophytes, the madrepore is the
most abundant. It occurs most frequently in tropical
countries, and decreases in number and variety as we approach
the poles. It encircles in prodigious rocks and
vast reefs many of the basaltic and other rocky islands in
the South Sea and Indian Ocean, and, by its daily
growth, adds to their magnitude. The coasts of the islands
in the West Indies, also those of the islands on
the east coast of Africa, and the shores and shoals of the
Red Sea, are encircled and incrusted with rocks of coral.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
Several different tribes of madrepore contribute to form
these coral reefs; but by far the most abundant are those
of the genera carophylla, astrea and meandrina. These
lithophytic animals not only add to the magnitude of land
already existing, but, according to some naturalists, they
form whole islands. Dr Forster, in his Observations made
during a Voyage round the World, gives an account of
the formation of these coral islands in the South Sea.</p>

<p>All the low isles, he says, seem to me to be a production
of the sea, or rather its inhabitants, the polype-like
animals forming the lithophytes. These animalcules
raise their habitation gradually from a small base, always
spreading more and more, in proportion as the structure
grows higher. The materials are a kind of lime mixed
with some animal substances. I have seen these large
structures in all stages, and of various extent. Near
Turtle Island, we found, at a few miles distance, and to
leeward of it, a considerable large circular reef, over
which the sea broke every where, and no part of it was
above water; it included a large deep lagoon. To the
east and north-east of the Society Isles, are a great many
isles, which in some parts are above water; in others,
the elevated parts are connected by reefs, some of which
are dry at low water, and others are constantly under
water. The elevated parts consist of a soil formed by a
sand of shells and coral rocks, mixed with a light black
mould, produced from putrified vegetables, and the dung
of sea-fowls; and are commonly covered by cocoa-nut
trees and other shrubs, and a few antiscorbutic plants.
The lower parts have only a few shrubs and the above
plants; others still lower, are washed by the sea at high-water.
All these isles are connected, and include a lagoon
in the middle, which is full of the finest fish; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
sometimes there is an opening, admitting a boat or canoe,
in the reef, but I never saw or heard of an opening that
would admit a ship.</p>

<p>The reef, or the first origin of these isles, is formed
by the animalcules inhabiting the lithophytes. They
raise their habitation within a little of the surface of the
sea, which gradually throws shells, weeds, sand, small
bits of corals, and other things, on the tops of these coral
rocks, and at last fairly raises them above water;
where the above things continue to be accumulated by
the sea, till by a bird, or by the sea, a few seeds of
plants that commonly grow on the sea-shore, are thrown
up, and begin to vegetate; and by their annual decay
and reproduction from seeds, create a little mould, yearly
accumulated by the mixture with sand, increasing the
dry spot on every side; till another sea happens to carry
a cocoa-nut hither, which preserves its vegetative power
a long time in the sea, and therefore will soon begin to
grow on this soil; especially as it thrives equally in all
kinds of soil; and thus may all these low isles have become
covered with the finest cocoa-nut trees.</p>

<p>The animalcules forming these reefs want to shelter
their habitation from the impetuosity of the winds, and
the power and rage of the ocean; but as, within the tropics,
the winds blow commonly from one quarter, they,
by instinct, endeavour to stretch only a ledge, within
which is a lagoon, which is certainly entirely screened
against the power of both. This, therefore, might account
for the method employed by the animalcules in building
only narrow ledges of coral rocks, to secure in their middle
a calm and sheltered place; and this seems to me to
be the most probable cause of the origin of all the Tropical
Low Isles, over the whole South Sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span></p>

<p>That excellent navigator, the late Captain Flinders,
gives the following interesting account of the formation
of Coral Islands, particularly of Half-way Island on the
north coast of Terra Australis<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This little island, or rather the surrounding reef,
which is three or four miles long, affords shelter from the
south-east winds; and being at a moderate day’s run
from Murray’s Isles, it forms a convenient anchorage for
the night to a ship passing through Torres’ Strait: I
named it <em>Half-way Island</em>. It is scarcely more than a
mile in circumference, but appears to be increasing both
in elevation and extent. At no very distant period of
time, it was one of those banks produced by the washing
up of sand and broken coral, of which most reefs afford
instances, and those of Torres’ Strait a great many.
These banks are in different stages of progress: some,
like this, are become islands, but not yet habitable; some
are above high-water mark, but destitute of vegetation;
whilst others are overflowed with every returning tide.</p>

<p>“It seems to me, that, when the animalcules which
form the corals at the bottom of the ocean cease to live,
their structures adhere to each other, by virtue either of
the glutinous remains within, or of some property in salt
water; and the interstices being gradually filled up with
sand and broken pieces of coral washed by the sea, which
also adhere, a mass of rock is at length formed. Future
races of these animalcules erect their habitations upon
the rising bank, and die in their turn, to increase, but
principally to elevate, this monument of their wonderful
labours. The care taken to work perpendicularly in the
early stages, would mark a surprising instinct in these
diminutive creatures. Their wall of coral, for the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
part, in situations where the winds are constant, being
arrived at the surface, affords a shelter, to leeward of
which their infant colonies may be safely sent forth; and
to this, their instinctive foresight, it seems to be owing,
that the windward side of a reef exposed to the open sea,
is generally, if not always, the highest part, and rises almost
perpendicular, sometimes from the depth of 200,
and perhaps many more fathoms. To be constantly covered
with water, seems necessary to the existence of the
animalcules, for they do not work, except in holes upon
the reef, beyond low-water mark; but the coral, sand,
and other broken remnants thrown up by the sea, adhere
to the rock, and form a solid mass with it, as high as the
common tides reach. That elevation surpassed, the future
remnants, being rarely covered, lose their adhesive
property; and remaining in a loose state, form what is
usually called a <em>key</em>, upon the top of the reef. The new
bank is not long in being visited by sea-birds: salt plants
take root upon it, and a soil begins to be formed; a cocoa-nut,
or the drupe of a pandanus, is thrown on shore;
land birds visit it, and deposit the seeds of shrubs and
trees; every high tide, and still more every gale, adds
something to the bank; the form of an island is gradually
assumed; and last of all comes man to take possession.</p>

<p>“Half-way Island is well advanced in the above progressive
state; having been many years, probably some
ages, above the reach of the highest spring tides, or the
wash of the surf in the heaviest gales. I distinguished,
however, in the rock which forms its basis, the sand, coral,
and shells, formerly thrown up, in a more or less
perfect state of cohesion. Small pieces of wood, pumice
stone, and other extraneous bodies which chance had
mixed with the calcareous substances when the cohesion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
began, were inclosed in the rock; and in some cases were
still separable from it without much force. The upper
part of the island is a mixture of the same substances in a
loose state, with a little vegetable soil; and is covered
with the <em>casuarina</em> and a variety of other trees and
shrubs, which give food to parroquets, pigeons, and some
other birds; to whose ancestors, it is probable, the island
was originally indebted for this vegetation.”</p></div>

<p>Mr Chamisso, who accompanied Kotzebue in his voyage,
has published interesting observations on this subject.
He informs us that the low islands of the South
Sea and Indian Ocean owe their origin principally to the
operations of several species of coral. Their situation
with respect to each other, as they often form rows, their
union in several places in large groups, and their total
absence in other parts of the same seas, induce us to conclude,
that the corals have founded their building on shoals
of the sea; or, to speak more correctly, on the tops of
mountains lying under water. On the one side, as they increase,
they continue to approach the surface of the sea,
on the other side they enlarge the extent of their earth.
The larger species of corals, which form blocks, measuring
several fathoms in thickness, seem to prefer the
more violent surf on the external edge of the reef; this,
and the obstacles opposed to the continuation of their
life, in the middle of a broad reef, by the amassing of
the shells abandoned by the animals, and fragments of
corals, are probably the reason that the outer edge of the
reef first approaches the surface. As soon as it has
reached such a height, that it remains almost dry at low
water, the corals leave off building higher; sea-shells,
fragments of coral, shells of echini, and their broken-off
prickles, are united by the burning sun, through the me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>dium
of the cementing calcareous sand, which has arisen
from the pulverization of the above mentioned shells into
one whole or solid stone, which, strengthened by the continual
throwing up of new materials, gradually increases
in thickness till it at last becomes so high, that it is covered
only during some seasons of the year by the high
tides. The heat of the sun so penetrates the mass of
stone when it is dry, that it splits in many places, and
<ins class="corr" id="tn-385" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'breaks of in'">
breaks off in</ins> flakes. These flakes, so separated, are raised
one upon another by the waves at the time of high
water. The always active surf throws blocks of coral,
(frequently of a fathom in length, and three or four feet
thick,) and shells of marine animals, between and upon
the foundation stones; after this the calcareous sand lies
undisturbed, and offers to the seeds of trees and plants,
cast upon it by the waves, a soil upon which they rapidly
grow, to overshadow its dazzling white surface. Entire
trunks of trees, which are carried by the rivers from
other countries and islands, find here, at length, a resting
place after their long wanderings; with them come
some small animals, such as lizards and insects, as the
first inhabitants. Even before the trees form a wood,
the real sea-birds nestle here; strayed land-birds take refuge
in the bushes; and at a much later period, when
the work has been long since completed, man also appears,
builds his hut on the fruitful soil formed by the
corruption of the leaves of the trees, and calls himself
lord and proprietor of this new creation.</p>

<p>In the preceding account, we have seen how the exterior
edge of a submarine coral edifice first approaches
the surface of the water, and how this reef gradually assumes
the properties of land; the island, therefore, necessarily
has a circular form, and in the middle of it an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
inclosed lake. This lake, however, is not entirely inclosed;
(and it could not be, for without supply from
the sea it would soon be dried up by the rays of the sun,)
but the exterior wall consists of a great number of smaller
islands, which are separated from each other by sometimes
larger, sometimes smaller spaces. The number of
these islets amounts, in the larger coral islands, to sixty;
and between them it is not so deep but that it becomes
dry at the time of ebb. The interior sea has in the middle
generally a depth of from thirty to five-and-thirty fathoms;
but on all sides towards the land the depth gradually
increases. In those seas where the constant monsoons
prevail, where, consequently, the waves beat only on
one side of the reef or island, it is natural that this side of
the reef, exposed to the unremitting fury of the ocean,
should be formed chiefly by broken-off blocks of coral,
and fragments of shells, and first rise above the elements
that created it. It is only these islands respecting
the formation and nature of which we hitherto know
any thing with certainty; we are almost entirely without
any observations on those in the Indian and Chinese Sea,
which lie in the regions of the six months’ monsoons.
From the charts given of them, it is to be inferred that
every side is equally advanced in formation. The lee
side of such a coral reef in the Pacific Ocean, which is
governed by the constant monsoons, frequently does not
shew itself above the water, when the opposite side, from
time immemorial, has attained perfection in the atmospheric
region; the former reef is even interrupted in
many places by intervals tolerably broad, and of the same
depth as the inner sea, which have been left by nature,
like open gates, for the exploring mariner to enter the
internal calm and secure harbour. In their external<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
form the coral islands do not resemble each other; but
this, and the extent of each, probably depends on the
size of the submarine mountain tops, on which their basis
is founded. Those islands which have more length than
breadth, and are opposed in their greatest extent to the
winds and waves, are richer in fruitful islets than those
whose situation is not so adapted to a quick formation.
In the large island-chains, there are always some single
islets which have the appearance of high land; these lie
upon an angle projecting into the sea, are exposed to the
surf upon two sides, consist therefore almost entirely of
large blocks of coral, and are destitute of smaller fragments
of shells and coral sand to fill up the intervals.
They are, therefore, not adapted to support plants requiring
a depth of soil, and only afford a basis to high
trees, provided with fibrous roots, (as the Pisonia, Cordia
Sebastiana, L.; Morinda citrifolia, L.; and Pandanus
odoratissimus, L.), which, at a distance, give to
these, always very small islands, the form of a hill. The
inner shores of the island, exposed to the surf, consist of
fine sand, which is washed up by the tide. Between the
small islands under their protection, and even in the middle
of the inner sea, are found smaller pieces of coral,
which seek a quiet abode, form in time, though very
slowly, banks, till they at last reach the surface of the
water; gradually increase in extent; unite with the
islands that surround them; and at length fill up the
minor seas, so that what was at first a ring of islands,
becomes one connected land. The islands which are so
far formed, retain in the middle a flat plain, which is always
lower than the wall that surrounds them on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
banks; for which reason pools of water are formed in
them, after a continued rain,&mdash;the only springs and wells
they possess. One of the peculiarities of these islands is,
that no dew falls in the evening, that they cause no tempests,
and do not check the course of the wind. The very
low situation of the country sometimes exposes the inhabitants
to great danger, and threatens their lives when the
waves roll over their islands, if it happens that the equinox
and full moon fall on the same day (consequently
when the water has reached its greatest height), and a
storm agitates the sea at the same time. These islands
are said to be also shaken by earthquakes.</p>

<p>MM. Quoy and Gaimard, in a lately published memoir,
propose, <em>1st</em>, To examine how corals raise their habitations
upon rocks, and what circumstances are favourable
or unfavourable to their growth. <em>2d</em>, To shew
that there are no islands of any extent, constantly inhabited
by man, which are entirely formed of corals; and
that far from raising from the depths of the ocean perpendicular
walls, as has been alleged, these animals form
only layers or crusts of a few fathoms thickness.</p>

<p>The following, according to the French naturalists,
is the manner in which this addition or superposition
of madrepores is effected. In the places where the
heat is constantly intense, where the land is indented
by bays containing shallow and quiet water, which is
not liable to be agitated by great surges, or by the regular
breezes of the tropics, there also the saxigenous
polypi multiply. They construct their habitations on
the submarine rocks, envelope these rocks in whole or in
part, but do not form them properly speaking. Thus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
all those reefs, those girdles of madrepore, which are so
frequently met with in the South Sea, to the leeward of
islands, are shoals depending upon the conformation of
the original ground, which will be perceived to belong
to it when the direction of the mountains and hills has
been attentively observed. It is always where the slopes
are gentle, and the sea shallowest, that the greatest masses
of madrepores are found. They sprout up if it is calm;
in the contrary case, they form only scattered tufts, belonging
to species which seem to be least affected by the
agitation of the waters.</p>

<p>It has been said, and it is even a matter of general belief
among mariners, say MM. Quoy and Gaimard, that
there occur in the equatorial seas shoals composed of <em>corals</em>,
which rise from the greatest depths, like walls at the
bottom of which the sounding line finds no ground. The
fact certainly does exist in so far as regards the depth
spoken of; and it is this very circumstance which is productive
of so much danger to vessels, which, when taken
in a calm and carried away by currents, cannot cast anchor
in such places. But it is not correct to say that these
reefs are entirety formed of madrepores. First, because
the species which always form the most considerable banks,
such as some meandrinæ, certain caryophylleæ, but especially
the astreæ, adorned with the most beautiful and
velvety colours, require the influence of light to perfect
them; because they are not seen to grow beyond a
few yards of depth; and because they cannot consequently
be developed at a depth of ten or twelve hundred feet,
as they would necessarily be, did they raise the cliffs in
question. Besides, these different species of animals
would then almost exclusively enjoy the privilege of living<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
at all depths, under all degrees of pressure, and, so to
speak, in all temperatures.</p>

<p>Another circumstance to which navigators have not adverted,
which corroborates the opinion here stated, is,
that, in depths so great as those to which we allude, the
sea, always agitated at the surface, breaks with force upon
these reefs, without requiring for that purpose any additional
impulse from the winds. And by merely attending
to the necessary consequences of the observations of
these same navigators, who say (what is very true) that,
wherever the waves are agitated, the lithophytes are unable
to go on with their work, because they destroy their
frail edifices, we shall acquire the moral certainty that
these submarine steeps are not produced by these animalcules.
But, in these same places, let there occur a hollow,
a sheltered spot of some kind, and then they will immediately
raise their habitations, and will contribute to
diminish the little depth that already exists there. And
this is what may be seen in almost all the places where
an elevated temperature permits these animals to grow in
abundance.</p>

<p>In the localities where the tides are sensible, their currents
alone may sometimes form irregular canals between
the madrepores, without their ever being encumbered
with their species, from the twofold cause united, of
the motion and the coldness of the water; while, on the
other hand, the flexible alcyonia are seen to multiply
there.</p>

<p>When these geological dispositions are carefully observed,
we see that the zoophytes rise to the surface of
the waves, never beyond it; after which the generation
which has attained thus far appears to die. It is de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>stroyed
much sooner, if, from the effect of the tides, these
frail animalcules are exposed naked to the action of a
burning sun. When there occur small hollows in these
heaps of inert spoils, deprived of their inhabitants, which
are always covered by the water, several tufts of those
lithophytes are still remarked, which, having escaped from
the almost general destruction, glow with the most lively
colours. Then, the families which are developed anew,
not being able to build on the outside of those reefs on
which the sea is constantly breaking, draw nearer and
nearer the shore, where the waves now deadened have
scarcely any more action upon them, as in the Isle of
France, at Timor, the Papua, the Marian, and the
Sandwich Islands; provided always the waters had not
a great depth, as is the case at Turtle Island, of which
Cook speaks, where no bottom is found between the
madrepore reefs and the island, notwithstanding the
shortness of the space which exists between these two
points.</p>

<p>If we examine these animals in the places best adapted
to their growth, we shall see their different species, the
forms of which, as varied as they are elegant, become
rounded into balls, spread out into fans, or ramify into
trees, mingling together, blending with each other, and
reflecting the varied hues of red, yellow, blue and violet.</p>

<p>It is well known that all these alleged walls, exclusively
formed of corals, are intersected with openings through
which the sea enters and retires with violence; and every
body knows the danger which Captain Cook ran on one
occasion, on the coast of New Holland, when he had no
other resource, in order to save himself from destruction,
than to take the sudden resolution of attempting one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
these narrow passes, where one is always sure of finding
plenty of water. And this circumstance also comes in
support of what we have advanced; for, if these perpendicular
walls were entirely composed of madrepores, they
would present no deep openings in their continuity, because
it is the property of zoophytes to build in masses
that have no interruption; and because, again, could they
raise themselves from very great depths, they would end
with encumbering and shutting up these passages; a circumstance
which does not take place, and probably never
will, from the causes which we have related.</p>

<p>If these facts prove, that madrepores cannot exist at
very great depths, the submarine rocks, which they only
increase in height, are not, therefore, exclusively formed
by them.</p>

<p>We now come to the second part of the argument;
and we assert, that there are no islands of any magnitude
and constantly inhabited by man, that are formed by corals;
and that the layers which they construct under the
water, are not more than a few fathoms in thickness.</p>

<p>We shall commence with the second part of this question.
The impossibility of penetrating to the bottom of
the sea to examine at what precise depth the solid zoophytes
establish themselves, constrains us to confine ourselves
to what has taken place in former times; and the
monuments which the ancient revolutions of the globe
have disclosed to our view, will serve to prove what is
going on in our own days. We shall mention what has
been seen in several places, and we shall first speak of the
island which Peron took for the theatre of the great works
of these polypi, namely the island of Timor.</p>

<p>The banks of coral which the sea has left exposed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
the land, as it retired, are remarkable for their uncommon
magnitude. The whole shores of Coupang are formed of
them, and the low hills in its vicinity are enveloped in
them; but a few hundred yards from the town, they disappear,
when distinct strata of slate make their appearance.
The corals form a bed over the subjacent rocks
from 25 to 80 feet thick.</p>

<p>Every thing announces that, in the Island of Timor,
there exist no mountains exclusively formed of corals.
As in all extensive countries, they are composed of various
substances. Quoy and Gaimard having coasted it
for about fifty leagues, sufficiently near to enable them to
form an idea of its geography, were able to see that it exhibited
volcanic appearances in several parts. Besides it
abounds in mines of gold and copper, which, in conjunction
with what we have already mentioned, shews in a
general way the nature of the rocks of which it is composed.</p>

<p>Perhaps, remarks Quoy and Gaimard, the Bald-Head,
a mountain of King George’s harbour in New Holland,
which Vancouver has described in passing, and on the summit
of which he saw perfectly preserved branches of coral,
might be adduced as a fact in opposition to the opinion
here advanced. Yet the phenomenon exhibited there, is
still precisely the same as at Timor, and in a thousand
other places<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>. The zoophytes have built upon a basis
previously existing, and they occupy only the surface of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
it. For why should this Bald-Head differ from Mount
Gardner, which, although close by it, is formed of primitive
rocks? Besides, Peron says, that it has the same geological
constitution. (T. ii. p. 133.)</p>

<p>At Rota, one of the Marian Isles, M. Gaudichaud,
detached from the limestone rock, at about a hundred
toises above the level of the sea, branches of true madrepores,
in perfect preservation. Here are, then, three localities
in which they are found at great heights. We
have observed them, say the French naturalists, at infinitely
lower elevations in several other places, as at the Isle
of France, where they form a bed more than six feet
thick, between two streams of lava; at Wahou, one of the
Sandwich Islands, where they have not a greater elevation,
but extend for several hundred toises over the surface
of the island. In all these cases, it is necessary to distinguish
between the lithophytes, which have, by their living
powers, formed continuous masses, from those which, after
having been rolled about, broken down by the water,
and mixed with sea shells, contribute to form those deposits
known by the name of <em>madrepore limestone</em>. The
latter sort is nothing but the debris of the former. Deposits
of this description occur in the Marian Isles, and
in those of the Papous; they occur also on the coasts of
France, and in several other places.</p>

<p>It would appear from observations made in Timor and
other places, that the species of the genus Astræa which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
are the only ones capable of covering immense extents of
surface, do not commence their operations at a greater
depth than twenty-five or thirty feet, in order to raise
their habitations to near the surface of the sea. Fragments
of these species are never obtained, either with the
sounding line, or upon the anchors; nor do we ever see
them, unless in places where the water is shallow; while
the branched madrepores, which do not form thick and
continuous beds, either on the elevated places which the
ocean has left, or on the shores where they still exist, live
at considerable depths.</p>

<p>It is evident, then, that these corals have erected their
fabrics on the summits of submarine hills and mountains;
and that all those reefs of Taiti, the Dangerous Archipelago,
Navigators’ Islands, the Friendly Islands, &amp;c.
are composed of madrepores only at the surface.</p>

<p>We thus consider it demonstrated, that the rocks of the
solid zoophytes or coral, are not capable of forming the immense
bases on which the greater number of the islands
that occur in the Pacific Ocean rest.</p>

<p>There now remains for us to state how these animals,
by their union, are capable of raising small islets. Forster,
as already stated, has given a very good description
of the manner in which this is effected. In fact, when
these animalcules have raised their habitations to the surface
of the water, under the shelter of the land, and they
remain uncovered during the reflux of the tide, the hurricanes
which sometimes supervene, by the agitation which
they produce in those shallow waters, throw up from the
bottom sand and mud. These substances are detained
in the sinuosities and cavities formed between the corals,
and thus serve to fix them together, and connect them in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>to
masses. Whenever the summit of this new island can
remain constantly uncovered by the sea, and the waves
can no longer destroy what they themselves have contributed
to form, then its extent is enlarged, and its edges
are gradually raised by the successive addition of sand.
According to the direction of the winds and currents they
may long remain sterile; but if the seeds of vegetables be
transported to them from the neighbouring shores, by the
action of these two causes, then, in latitudes favourable to
their development, we presently see these islands becoming
covered with verdure, the successively accumulated remains
of which form layers of soil, which contribute to the elevation
of the surface.</p>

<p>But, in order that this phenomenon of growth be accomplished,
the distance from land must not be too great,
because then the vegetables cannot get so easily to the
islets in question, which then remain almost always bare
and sterile. And for this reason what navigators report
of those madrepore Islands of the Great Ocean, which are
covered with verdure, and are yet at a great distance from
any known land, has always appeared to us extraordinary;
and that so much the more, that, in those vast
spaces, the violence of the waves, which nothing can
break there, must disturb the operations of the zoophytes.
We do not, however, deny the existence of these islands,
which it would be interesting carefully to examine anew;
for, whenever navigators meet with low islands between the
Tropics, they do not hesitate, in compliance with the generally
received opinion, to say that they consist of madrepores.
Yet how many islands, which scarcely rise above
the surface of the water, recognise no such origin?
We may mention, as an example, the Island of Boni, si<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>tuated
under the equator, the beautiful vegetation of
which rises upon limestone. Cocoa Island, near Guam,
is in the same condition, being also composed of limestone.
In general, if they are inhabited, consequently
they have springs or lakes of fresh water, we may almost
be certain that they are not composed of lithophytes, or
are only so in part, because springs could not be formed
in their porous substances. Some of the Caroline Isles
are excessively low; we supposed them encrusted with
madrepores; and as they have inhabitants there must be
somewhere in them a soil favourable to the accumulation
of fresh water<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>.</p>

<p>In restraining the power of these animalcules, concludes
Quoy and Gaimard, and in pointing out the limits
which nature has prescribed them, we have no other object
than to furnish more correct data to the naturalists
who aspire to great hypothetical considerations, regarding
the conformation of the globe. On reconsidering
these zoophytes with greater attention, they will no longer
be seen filling up the basins of the seas, raising islands,
increasing the size of the continents, threatening future
generations with a solid equatorial circle formed of their
spoils. Their influence, with regard to the road-steads
or harbours, in which they multiply, is already great
enough, without adding more to it. But, compared with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
the masses on which they rest, what are their layers, often
interrupted, and which must be searched for with care,
before they can be recognised, to the enormous volcanic
peaks of the Sandwich Islands, the Island of Bourbon,
the Moluccas, the Marian Islands, the mountains of
Timor, New Guinea, &amp;c. &amp;c.? Nothing, certainly; and
the solid zoophytes are in no degree capable of being
compared with the testaceous mollusca, with reference
to the materials which they have furnished, and still continue
to furnish to the crust of the Globe.</p>

<h3 class="fs70">ON THE LEVEL OF THE BALTIC.</h3>

<p>About the middle of the last century, a controversy
took place among the natural philosophers of the north
of Europe, regarding the alleged gradual lowering of
the level of the sea in general, and of the Baltic Sea in
particular. Celsius was the first who introduced this
idea to notice. He generalised it by applying it to all
the planets, and was supported by the authority of the
celebrated Linnæus. He soon perceived, however, that
the point could never be settled by mere discussion, and
that facts alone could lead to any certain result. Observation
was therefore had recourse to; and thus the dispute
in question had at least one good effect, that of directing
to the subject the attention of men of science,
whose situation might enable them to mark the variations
of level that take place along the coasts of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
North Sea. The results of investigations undertaken for
this purpose, are now beginning to be collected.</p>

<p>In the course of 1820 and 1821, Mr Bruncrona, assisted
by the officers of the Pilotage Establishment, and
other qualified persons, undertook the examination of all
the authentic measures that had been established upon
the west coast of the Baltic, during the last half century.
The results of this examination are given in a short
memoir, inserted in the Swedish Transactions for 1823.
The following table indicates the degree to which the
level of the sea has fallen during the last forty years, on
the coast of Sweden, at various latitudes. It is proper
to remark, that, in some of the places observed, the measures
were much older, and in some others much more
recent, than the period of forty years. In both these
cases, the change of level that must have been effected
during this period, has been estimated, by calculating
the mean annual depression furnished by the observations.</p>

<p>Of the facts collected in the course of this investiga<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>tion,
the following may be mentioned as tending to support
the opinion of a fall of level.</p>

<p><em>1st</em>, It is generally believed among the pilots of
the Baltic, that the sea has become shallower along
the course which vessels ordinarily follow; but, it is
added, that this alteration is more sensible in the places
where the tide collects sand, detached pebbles, and
sea-weeds, or in those where the bottom is composed of
rocks. The same observation has been made in the
neighbourhood of some large towns and fisheries; for
example, a hydrographic chart made in 1771, gives six
fathoms for the mean depth of the sea opposite the harbour
of Landskrona, whereas, in 1817, the sounding
line scarcely gave five fathoms at the same point.</p>

<p><em>2d</em>, According to the oldest and most experienced
pilots, the straits which separate the numerous islets
scattered along the coast of Sweden, from Haarparanda
to the frontiers of Norway, received vessels that drew
ten feet of water; now they are not practicable for
boats that draw more than two or three feet.</p>

<p><em>3d</em>, The pilots further affirm, that, along the whole
coast of Bahusia, the bottom undergoes a diminution,
which becomes sensible every ten years in certain places,
where it is composed of rocks. Several other parts of
the Baltic may be cited, in which a similar change has
been remarked.</p>

<p>M. C. P. Hallstrom, in an Appendix to Mr Bruncrona’s
Memoir, gives the following table of the diminution
observed in the depth of the waters of the Gulf of
Bothnia.</p>

<p class="p1">It is not demonstrated that the numbers of the last
column represent exactly the lowering of the water in a
century; for it has not yet been sufficiently determined
if this lowering be uniform, or if it vary at different periods,
and if it depend upon some local circumstance,&mdash;upon
the climate,&mdash;or upon the state of the atmosphere.
Nor is it properly established, that this lowering, which
becomes less perceptible from the north of the Baltic, until
it disappears entirely at the southern extremity, follows
precisely the same law of diminution as the latitude.
It appears to be uniform in the whole extent of
the Gulf of Bothnia, and it rises about four feet and a
quarter in that region; at Calmar (lat. 57° 50′) it is only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
two feet; but it is not yet known whether it decreases
in a regular manner between these two places.</p>

<p>Some authors consider the facts related by MM.
Bruncrona and Halstrom, as deciding the question in favour
of those who believe in a lowering of the level of
the Baltic. The editor of the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Annalen der Physik</cite><a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> goes
farther, and seems to consider it as confirming the opinion
of a general lowering of the level of the sea. In
support of this opinion, he adduces the traditions and
observations of the natives of Otaheite and of the Moluccas
and Sunda Islands, regarding the retreat of the
sea in several parts of their coast. We are disposed to
stand neutral in this matter. The geographers who have
collected the greatest number of facts relating to the level
of the inland seas, and of the ocean in its various regions,
find nearly as many in favour of a rise as in favour
of a fall of level. The very distribution of contrary indications,
leads them to believe in a partial displacement
of the mass of waters from one region towards another,
and even from the one side of an inland sea towards the
opposite side; a displacement which might be owing to
fugitive or more or less durable causes, such as a variation
of temperature in the polar regions, the action of
winds and of currents, modified by the greater or less
quantity of water in the rivers that feed the different basins,
upon the sides opposed to their direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span></p>

<p>Are the facts contained in the memoir in question of a
nature to overthrow this opinion? They do not appear
so to us. The two series of observations which are adduced,
only shew a fall upon the coasts of Sweden, properly
so called, that is to say, upon the west coast of the
Baltic, and the east coast of the Cattegat. Two observations
only have been made upon the coasts of Finland,
toward the extremity of the Gulf of Bothnia. These
facts would perfectly accord with the opinion of those
who think that the currents determined from the north
to the south of the Baltic by the numerous streams
which rush into it, push the waters toward the south
shore, that of Pomerania, Mecklenbourg, and Holstein;
and that the waters consequently gain upon the land on
this coast, as numerous historical facts attest, while they
retire along the northern shores, those of the Gulf of
Bothnia. Be this as it may, the question as to the constancy
of the level of the sea cannot be considered as decided,
until a long series of observations shall have been
made upon authentic and perfectly fixed measures erected
upon all the shores of the different seas, and of the
different regions of the ocean. Those which have been
published in the Swedish Transactions furnish important
documents for this purpose; and similar ones should
be begun to be collected in other countries.</p>

<p>The phenomena exhibited by the waters of the Baltic
engaged the attention of two rival speculators, Playfair
and Deluc; and their views are often alluded to by geologists.
We shall here state them in their own words.
Professor Playfair, in his well known and elegant work
on the Huttonian Theory of the Earth, has the following
remarks:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If we proceed further to the north, to the shores of
the <em>Baltic</em> for instance, we have undoubted evidence of
a <em>change of level</em> in the same direction as on our own
shores. The level of the sea has been represented as
lowering at so great a rate as <em>forty inches in a century</em>.
Celsius observed, that several rocks which are now above
the water, were not long ago sunken rocks, and dangerous
to navigators; and he took particular notice of one
which, in the year 1680, was on the surface of the water,
and, in the year 1731, was 20½ Swedish inches above
it. From an inscription near <em>Aspo</em>, in the lake <em>Melar</em>,
which communicates with the <em>Baltic</em>, engraved, as is
supposed, about five centuries ago, the level of the sea
appears to have sunk in that time no less than thirteen
Swedish feet. All these facts, with many more which
it is unnecessary to enumerate, make the <em>gradual depression</em>,
not only of the <em>Baltic</em>, but of the whole <em>Northern
Ocean</em>, a matter of certainty.”&mdash;<cite>Playfair’s Illustrations</cite>,
p. 445.</p></div>

<p>That indefatigable and accurate observer De Luc, has
the following commentary on the preceding passage.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It would be unnecessary to mention even the two inconsiderable
facts above, if the <em>depression</em> of the <em>level</em> of
the seas were indeed a matter of certainty; for the best
authenticated and the least equivocal monuments of their
change would then abound along all their coasts. But
proofs are every where found that such a change is chimerical:
they may be seen in all the vales coming down
to these seas, in which there is no perceptible impression
of the action of any waters but those of the land, and no
vestige, through their whole extent, of any permanent
abode of those of the sea; and proofs to the same effect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
are equally visible, along the coasts of both these seas,
in all the new lands which have been formed on them,
and which, being perfectly horizontal from the point
where their formation commenced, evidently show that
the water displaced by them has been constantly at the
same level. Hence appears the necessity of multiplying,
as I have done, and shall continue to do, for the subversion
of a prejudice of such ancient date, the examples
of these peremptory proofs of its total want of foundation.
The rock mentioned by Celsius had probably been
observed by him at times when the level of the sea was
different; its known differences much exceeding the
quantity here specified. As for the inscription near
Aspo, in a country abounding with lakes as much as that
which I have above described, if we are acquainted
with its terms, we should probably find it to be, like
many which I have seen in various places along the
course of the Oder and the Elbe, the monument of some
extraordinary inundation of the land, from the sudden
melting of the snows in the mountains, at a time when
the water had been prevented from running off by an
equally extraordinary rise of the level of the sea; of which
the effects on low coasts may extend very far inland.</p>

<p>“By this conclusion, however, from these few facts,
contrary to every thing observed on the coasts of this
sea, Mr Playfair thinks himself authorised to maintain,
that the gradual depression, not only of the Baltic, but
of the whole northern ocean, is a matter of certainty; afterwards
he examines merely which of these two causes,
the subsidence of the sea itself, or the elevation of the
land around it, agrees the best with the phenomena; and
he decides in favour of the latter, pointing out its accordance
with the Huttonian Theory.”</p></div>

<h3 class="fs70">FOSSIL REMAINS OF THE HUMAN SPECIES.</h3>

<p>From the observations of Werner and others, it appears,
that the most simple animals are those first met
with in a mineralized state; that these are succeeded by
others more perfect, and which are contained in newer
formations; and that the most perfect, as quadrupeds,
occur only in the newest formation. But we naturally
inquire, have no remains of the human species been hitherto
discovered in any of the formations? Judging
from the arrangement already mentioned, we would naturally
expect to meet with remains of man in the newest
of the formations. In the writings of ancient authors
there are descriptions of anthropolithi. In the
year 1577, Fel. Plater, Professor of Anatomy at Basle,
described several fossil bones of the elephant found at
Lucerne, as those of a giant at least nineteen feet
high. The Lucernese were so perfectly satisfied with
this discovery, that they caused a painting to be made of
the giant, as he must have appeared when alive, assumed
two such giants as the supporters of the city arms, and
had the painting hung in their public hall. The Landvoigt
Engel, not satisfied with this account of these remains,
maintained that our planet, before the creation of
the present race of men, was inhabited by fallen angels,
and that these bones were part of the skeletons of some
of those miserable beings. Scheuchzer published an engraving
and description of a fossil human skeleton, which
proved to be a gigantic species of salamander or proteus.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
Spallanzani describes a hill of fossil human bones in the
island of Cerigo; but this also is an error, as has been
satisfactorily shewn by Blumenbach. Lately, however,
a fossil human skeleton has been imported into this country
from Guadaloupe, by Sir Alexander Cochrane. It
is imbedded in a block of calcareous stone, composed of
particles of limestone and coral, and which, like the aggregations
of shells found on the limestone coasts in some
parts of this country, has acquired a great degree of
hardness. It is therefore an instance of a fossil human
petrifaction in an alluvial formation. The engraving
here given is copied from the Philosophical Transactions
of the Royal Society of London; and the following description
of the fossil remains it exhibits is that of Mr
Konig, which has been drawn up with great care.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The situation of the skeleton in the block was so
superficial, that its presence in the rock on the coast had
probably been indicated by the projection of some of the
more elevated parts of the left fore-arm.</p>

<p>“The operation of laying the bones open to view, and
of reducing the superfluous length of the block at its
extremities, being performed with all the care which its
excessive hardness, and the relative softness of the bones,
required, the skeleton exhibited itself in the manner represented
in the annexed drawing (Pl. I.) with which
my friend Mr Alexander has been so good as to illustrate
this description.</p>

<p>“The skull is wanting; a circumstance which is the
more to be regretted, as this characteristic part might
possibly have thrown some light on the subject under
consideration, or would, at least, have settled the question,
whether the skeleton is that of a Carib, who used<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
to give the frontal bone of the head a particular shape
by compression, which had the effect of depressing the
upper and protruding the lower edge of the orbits, so as
to make the direction of their opening nearly upwards,
or horizontal, instead of vertical<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>.</p>

<p>“The vertebræ of the neck were lost with the head.
The bones of the thorax bear all the marks of considerable
concussion, and are completely dislocated. The
seven true ribs of the left side, though their heads are
not in connexion with the vertebræ, are complete; but
only three of the false ribs are observable. On the right
side only fragments of these bones are seen; but the
upper part of the seven true ribs of this side are found
on the left, and might at first sight be taken for the termination
of the left ribs; as may be seen in the drawing.
The right ribs must therefore have been violently
broken and carried over to the left side, where, if this
mode of viewing the subject be correct, the sternum must
likewise lie concealed below the termination of the ribs.
The small bone dependent above the upper ribs of the
left side, appears to be the right clavicle. The right os
humeri is lost; of the left nothing remains except the
condyles in connexion with the fore-arm, which is in the
state of pronation; the radius of this side exists nearly
in its full length, while of the ulna the lower part only
remains, which is considerably pushed upwards. Of the
two bones of the right fore-arm, the inferior terminations
are seen. Both the rows of the bones of the wrists are
lost, but the whole metacarpus of the left hand is displayed,
together with part of the bones of the fingers:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
the first joint of the fore-finger rests on the upper ridge
of the os pubis; the two others, detached from their metacarpal
bones, are propelled downwards, and situated at
the inner side of the femur, and below the foramen magnum
ischii of this side. Vestiges of three of the fingers
of the right hand are likewise visible, considerably below
the lower portion of the fore-arm, and close to the
upper extremity of the femur. The vertebræ may be
traced along the whole length of the column, but are in
no part of it well defined. Of the os sacrum, the superior
portion only is distinct: it is disunited from the last
vertebra and the ilium, and driven upwards. The left
os ilium is nearly complete, but shattered, and one of the
fragments depressed below the level of the rest; the ossa
pubis, though well defined, are gradually lost in the
mass of the stone. On the right side, the os innominatum
is completely shattered, and the fragments are sunk:
but towards the acetabulum, part of its internal cellular
structure is discernible.</p>

<p>“The thigh-bones, and the bones of the leg of the
right side, are in good preservation, but being considerably
turned outwards, the fibula lies buried in the stone,
and is not seen. The lower part of the femur of this
side is indicated only by a bony outline, and appears to
have been distended by the compact limestone that fills
the cavities both of the bones of the leg and thigh, and
to the expansion of which, these bones probably owe
their present shattered condition. The lower end of the
left thigh-bone appears to have been broken and lost in
the operation of detaching the block; the two bones of
the leg, however, on this side, are nearly complete; the
tibia was split almost the whole of its length a little be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>low
the external edge, and the fissure being filled up with
limestone, now presents itself as a dark-coloured straight
line. The portion of the stone which contained part of
the bones of the tarsus and metatarsus, was unfortunately
broken; but the separate fragments are preserved.</p>

<p>“The whole of the bones, when first laid bare, had a
mouldering appearance, and the hard surrounding stone
could not be detached without frequently injuring their
surface; but after an exposure for some days to the air,
they acquired a considerable degree of hardness. Sir H.
Davy, who subjected a small portion of them to chemical
analysis, found that they contained part of their animal
matter, and all their phosphate of lime.”</p></div>

<h3><em>Account of the Displacement of that part of the Coast
of the Adriatic which is occupied by the Mouths of
the Po.</em></h3>

<p>That portion of the shore of the Adriatic which lies
between the lake, or rather <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lagune</i>, of Commachio, and
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lagunes</i> of Venice, has undergone considerable alterations
since ancient times, as is attested by authors worthy
of entire credit, and as is still evinced by the actual
state of the soil in the districts near the coast; but it is
impossible now to give any exact detail of the successive
progress of these changes, and more especially of their
precise measures during the ages which preceded the
twelfth century of our era.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span></p>

<p>We are, however, certain, that the city of <em>Hatria</em>, now
called <em>Adria</em>, was formerly situated on the edge of the
coast; and by this we attain a known fixed point upon
the primitive shore, whence the nearest part of the present
coast, at the mouth of the Adige, is at the distance
of 25,000 <em>metres</em><a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>; and it will be seen in the sequel, that
the extreme point of the alluvial promontory formed by
the Po, is farther advanced into the sea than the mouth
of the Adige by nearly 10,000 metres<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Adria have formed exaggerated
pretensions, in many respects, as to the high antiquity of
their city, though it is undeniably one of the most ancient
in Italy, as it gave name to the sea which once
washed its walls. By some researches made in its interior
and its environs, a stratum of earth has been found
mixed with fragments of Etruscan pottery, and with nothing
whatever of Roman manufacture. Etruscan and
Roman pottery are found mixed together in a superior
bed, on the top of which the vestiges of a theatre have
been discovered. Both of these beds are far below the
level of the present soil. I have seen at Adria very curious
collections, in which these remains of antiquity are
separately classed; and having, some years ago, observed
to the viceroy, that it would be of great importance, both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
to history and geology, to make a thorough search into
these buried remains at Adria, carefully noticing the levels
in comparison with the sea, both of the primitive
soil, and of the successive alluvial beds, his Highness entered
warmly into my ideas; but I know not whether
these propositions have been since carried into effect.</p>

<p>Following the coast, after leaving Hatria, which was
situated at the bottom of a small bay or gulf, we find to
the south a branch of the <em>Athesis</em> or Adige, and of the
<em>Fossa Philistina</em>, of which the remaining trace corresponds
to what might have been the Mincio and Tartaro
united, if the Po had still run to the south of Ferrara.
We next find the <em>Delta Venetum</em>, which seems to have
occupied the place where the lake or lagune of Commachio
is now situated. This delta was traversed by seven
branches of the <em>Eridanus</em> or Po, formerly called also the
<em>Vadis Padus</em> or <em>Podincus</em>; which river, at the diramification
of these seven branches, and upon its left or northern
bank, had a city named <em>Trigoboli</em>, whose site could
not be far from where Ferrara now stands. Seven lakes,
inclosed within this delta, were called <em>Septem Maria</em>,
and Hatria was sometimes denominated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Urbs Septem
Marium</i>, or the city of the seven seas or lakes.</p>

<p>Following the coast from Hatria to the northwards,
we come to the principal mouth of the <em>Athesis</em> or Adige,
formerly named <em>Fossa Philistina</em>, and afterwards <em>Estuarium
Altini</em>, an interior sea, separated by a range of
small islands from the Adriatic Gulf, in the middle of
which was a cluster of other small isles, called <em>Rialtum</em>,
and upon this archipelago the city of Venice is now seated.
The <em>Estuarium Altini</em> is what is now called the
Lagune of Venice, and no longer communicates with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
sea, except by five passages, the small islands of the Archipelago
having been united into a continuous dike.</p>

<p>To the east of the lagunes, and north from the city of
Este, we find the <em>Euganian</em> mountains, or hills, forming,
in the midst of a vast alluvial plain, a remarkable isolated
group of rounded hills, near which spot the fable
of the ancients supposes the fall of Phæton to have taken
place. Some writers have supposed that this fable may
have originated from the fall of some vast masses of inflamed
matters near the mouths of the Eridanus, that
had been thrown up by a volcanic explosion; and it is
certain that abundance of volcanic products are found in
the neighbourhood of Padua and Verona.</p>

<p>The most ancient notices that I have been able to
procure respecting the situation of the shores of the Adriatic
at the mouths of the Po, only begin to be precise in the
twelfth century. At that epoch the whole waters of
this river flowed to the south of Ferrara, in the <em>Po de
Volano</em> and the <em>Po di Primaro</em>, branches which inclosed
the space occupied by the <em>lagune</em> of Commachio. The
two branches which were next formed by an irruption
of the waters of the Po to the north of Ferraro, were
named the river of <em>Corbola</em>, <em>Longola</em>, or <em>Mazzorno</em>, and
the river <em>Toi</em>. The former, and more northern of these,
received the <em>Tartaro</em>, or <em>canal bianco</em>, near the sea, and
the latter was joined at Ariano by another branch derived
from the Po, called the <em>Goro river</em>. The sea-coast
was evidently directed from south to north, at the distance
of ten or eleven thousand <em>metres</em><a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> from the meridian of
Adria; and <em>Loreo</em>, to the north of <em>Mesola</em>, was only
about 2000 <em>metres</em><a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> from the coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span></p>

<p>Towards the middle of the twelfth century, the flood-waters
of the Po were retained on their left or northern
side by dikes near the small city of <em>Ficarolo</em>, which is
about 19,000 <em>metres</em><a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> to the north-west of Ferrara,
spreading themselves southwards over the northern part of
the territory of Ferrara and the <em>Polesine</em> of Rovigo, and
flowed through the two formerly mentioned canals of
<em>Mazzorno</em> and <em>Toi</em>. It seems perfectly ascertained, that
this change in the direction of the waters of the Po had
been produced by the effects of human labours; and the
historians who have recorded this remarkable fact only
differ from each other in some of the more minute details.
The tendency of the river to flow in the new channels,
which had been opened for the more ready discharge
of its waters when in flood, continually increased;
owing to which the two ancient chief branches, the <em>Volano</em>
and <em>Primaro</em>, rapidly decreased, and were reduced in
less than a century to their present comparatively insignificant
size; while the main direction of the river was
established between the mouth of the Adige to the north,
and what is now called <em>Porto di Goro</em>, on the south.
The two before-mentioned canals of <em>Mazzorno</em> and <em>Toi</em>
becoming insufficient for the discharge, others were dug;
and the principal mouth, called <em>Bocco Tramontana</em>, or
the northern mouth, having approached the mouth of
the Adige, the Venetians became alarmed in 1604; when
they excavated a new canal of discharge, named <em>Taglio
de Porto Viro</em>, or <em>Po delle Fornaci</em>, by which means the
<em>Bocco Maestra</em>, was diverted from the Adige towards the
south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span></p>

<p>During four centuries, from the end of the twelfth to
that of the sixteenth, the alluvial formations of the Po
gained considerably upon the sea. The northern mouth,
which had usurped the situation of the <em>Mazzorno</em> canal,
becoming the <em>Rama di Trimontana</em>, had advanced in
1600 to the distance of 20,000 <em>metres</em><a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> from the meridian
of Adria; and the southern mouth, which had taken
possession of the canal of <em>Toi</em>, was then 17,000 <em>metres</em><a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
advanced beyond the same point. Thus the shore
had become extended nine or ten thousand <em>metres</em><a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> to
the north, and six or seven thousand to the south<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>. Between
these two mouths there was formerly a bay, or a
part of the coast less advanced than the rest, called <em>Sacca
di Goro</em>. During the same period of four hundred
years previous to the commencement of the seventeenth
century, the great and extensive embankments of the Po
were constructed; and also, during the same period, the
southern slopes of the Alps began to be cleared and cultivated.</p>

<p>The great canal, denominated <em>Taglio di Porto Viro</em>,
or <em>Po delle Fornaci</em>, ascertains the advance of the alluvial
depositions in the vast promontory now formed by the
mouths or delta of the Po. In proportion as their entrances
into the sea extend from the original land, the
yearly quantity of alluvial depositions increases in an
alarming degree, owing to the diminished slope of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
streams, which was a necessary consequence, of the prolongation
of their bed, to the confinement of the waters
between dikes, and to the facility with which the increased
cultivation of the ground enabled the mountain torrents
which flowed into them to carry away the soil.
Owing to these causes, the bay called <em>Sacra di Goro</em>
was very soon filled up, and the two promontories which
had been formed by the two former principal mouths of
<em>Mazzorno</em> and <em>Toi</em>, were united into one vast projecting
cape, the most advanced point of which is now 32,000
or 33,000 <em>metres</em><a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> beyond the meridian of Adria: so
that in the course of two hundred years, the mouths or
delta of the Po have gained about 14,000 <em>metres</em><a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> upon
the sea.</p>

<p>From all these facts, of which I have given a brief
enumeration, the following results are clearly established.</p>

<p><em>First</em>, That, at some ancient period, the precise date
of which cannot be now ascertained, the waves of the
Adriatic washed the walls of Adria.</p>

<p><em>Secondly</em>, That, in the twelfth century, before a passage
had been opened for the waters of the Po at <em>Ficarrolo</em>;
on its left or northern bank, the shore had been already
removed to the distance of nine or ten thousand
<em>metres</em><a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> from Adria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span></p>

<p><em>Thirdly</em>, That the extremities of the promontories
formed by the two principal branches of the Po, before
the excavation of the <em>Taglio di Porto Viro</em>, had extended,
by the year 1600, or in four hundred years, to a medium
distance of 18,500 <em>metres</em><a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> beyond Adria; giving,
from the year 1200, an average yearly increase of the alluvial
land of 25 <em>metres</em><a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>.</p>

<p><em>Fourthly</em>, That the extreme point of the present single
promontory, formed by the alluvions of the existing
branches, is advanced to between thirty-two and thirty-three
thousand <em>metres</em><a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> beyond Adria; whence the average
yearly progress is about seventy <em>metres</em><a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> during the
last two hundred years, being a greatly more rapid proportion
than in former times.</p>

<h3><em>On the Universal Deluge.</em></h3>

<p>Mr Cuvier in the present work, and more recently in a
note to Mr Lemaire’s edition of Ovid’s Metamorphoses,
enumerates the Mosaic, Grecian, Assyrian, Persian, Indian,
and Chinese traditions, concerning a universal de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>luge;
and concludes from them, that the surface of the
globe, five or six thousand years ago, underwent a general
and sudden revolution, by which the lands inhabited
by the human beings who lived at that time, and by the
various species of animals known at the present day,
were overflowed by the ocean; out of which emerged the
present habitable portions of the globe. This celebrated
naturalist maintains, that these regions of the earth were
peopled by the few individuals who were preserved,
and that the tradition of the catastrophe has been preserved
among these new races of people, variously modified
by the difference of their situation and their social
disposition. According to Mr Cuvier, similar revolutions
of nature had taken place, at periods long antecedent
to that of the Mosaic deluge. The dry land was inhabited,
if not by human beings, at least by land animals
at an earlier period; and must have been changed from
the dry land to the bed of the ocean; and it might even
be concluded from the various species of animals contained
in it, that this change, as well as its opposite, had
occurred more than once.</p>

<p>This opinion being brought forward in a geognostic
work, especially in a work abounding in such valuable
matters of fact, and stated as the result of geognostic investigation,
we may be permitted, in this point of view, to
examine it; and to ask, whether, from the phenomena
exhibited by the present condition of the earth’s surface,
we are entitled to conclude that it owes its conformation
to such a universal deluge.</p>

<p>We know, from arguments suggested by chemistry
and the higher mechanics, that the globe was once in a
state of fluidity; hence it might be maintained with some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span>
appearance of probability, that the condition of the earth,
previous to the existence of organic matter, depended
upon fusion; and that the primitive rocks are of igneous
origin. Since, however, granite has been found above
rocks of various kinds which contain the remains of organic
bodies, we are under no necessity of ascribing to
primitive rocks an origin different from that of subsequent
formations; and, without having recourse to other
arguments, the fact, that aquatic animals are the most
abundant of fossil organic remains from the earliest of
the transition to the latest of the secondary and tertiary
formations, affords evidence that they are precipitates
from water.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great and daily advancement of
science, our knowledge of chemistry is still too imperfect
for us to arrive at an adequate knowledge of the state of
this water, or rather sea, as, from its universal expansion,
it must be denominated. Did it contain dissolved in it
at the same time all the materials from which the various
beds of rock were formed; what were the solvents of
those materials which we find, either insoluble in water,
or at least not easily soluble; by what means were the
precipitates produced; and whence came this prodigious
mass of waters? Upon these unanswered questions depend
others no less important. The aquatic animals of a
former world undoubtedly lived in this sea; otherwise, we
must admit of another sea free from heterogeneous materials.
But did these animals continue to live in it during
the whole process of precipitation; and did this process
proceed so slowly and imperceptibly, that animal life was
not interrupted by it, and that only remains of dead
animals, such as the skeletons of fishes, and the covering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
of shell-fishes, were enveloped in the precipitates? Or,
did animal life continue only during the state of solution;
and were the myriads of aquatic animals found in
beds of rocks buried in them alive? Many naturalists
appear to entertain the latter opinion, from observing
the agonies of death depicted in the distorted position of
fishes in copper-slate, or from deriving the bituminous
properties of stink-stone, as well as of marl, from the
decomposition of animal bodies, of which such numerous
vestiges are extant in these beds? In this way a plausible
explanation is given of the phenomena of a former
world that has perished. How, then, do they explain the
constant appearance of so many species, which have
continued without interruption for such an infinite length
of time? Have these species been propagated by individuals
who accidentally escaped destruction: or, Does a
new race continually spring up again? But laying
aside the difficulty of this explanation, the violent destruction
of so many races of animals, is scarcely consistent
with the general order of the universe, according to
which, we behold every animal occupying its proper element,
and fulfilling its particular destiny. We, therefore,
involuntarily revert to the opinion, that those creatures,
whose remains are preserved in beds of rocks,
have lived continually in the sea, out of which the rocks
were precipitated, in the same manner as the analogous
species now living in the sea become enveloped in deposits
still taking place, although on a comparatively small
scale.</p>

<p>What has just been said does not entitle us to admit
that the various parts of the earth have been, from time
to time, overflowed with water. Yet are there other ap<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>pearances
which completely indicate such a change,
namely, beds of coal, and the fossil remains of land animals.
The carbonisation of roots of trees in clefts of
rocks, and of marsh plants in peat-bogs, which takes
place, as it were, under our own immediate observation;
the transitions of bituminous wood into pitch-coal, the
frequent presence of vegetables partly converted into
coal, in the neighbourhood of beds of coal, and which
are more abundant the nearer they are to these beds;
and, finally, the chemical nature of coal, which is similar
to that of vegetables, go to prove the vegetable origin of
the older and independent coal formation.</p>

<p>Though some fossil vegetables might derive their
origin, by being floated to quarters more or less remote
from their native soil, as we find to be the case in
many islands of the South Sea, and on other shores;
on the other hand, neither the breadth and extent
of beds of coal, nor the erect position in which fossil
trees and reed plants are not unfrequently found in
their neighbourhood, coincide with such an explanation.
The plants, from which these beds were formed, once
stood and grew in the place where they were buried;
and, from these remains, we infer that they were entirely
land plants, tree-ferns, <em>Lycopodia</em>, and other cryptogamia.
It also appears undeniable, that the land, being
once dry, was, during a longer or shorter time, covered
with luxuriant vegetation; that it was afterwards overflowed
with water, and then became dry land again.
But, was this overflow of water produced by a sudden,
violent, and universal catastrophe, such as we consider the
deluge? Many circumstances leave room for opposite
conjecture. If it is probable that the older or black coal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
is of vegetable origin, the plants from which it has originated,
must have suffered an incomparably greater change
than those of more recent coal formations. Their composition
and their texture, afford evidence of a long operation
of the fluid in which the changes were produced;
and their situation, proves that the substance of the
plants, though not entirely dissolved, was yet much comminuted,
and was kept floating and swimming, and then
precipitated. How can we, in any other way, account
for the layers of sandstone and slate-clay, with which
coal regularly alternates, so that from one to sixty alternate
beds have been enumerated? How can we explain
the combination of mineral coal with slate-clay, or account
for the appearance of bituminous shale, flinty slate,
of iron-pyrites and iron-ore, in the midst of mineral coal
itself? We do not, however, admit of a repeated uncovering
and covering of the land with water, and of a renewal
of vegetation for every particular bed of coal; far from it,
for violent inundations exhibit very different phenomena.
These formations, like pure mineral formations, bear the
evident impress of a lengthened operation, and of gentle
precipitations; and whoever still entertains doubts regarding
this, may have them completely removed by
the condition in which vegetable remains are frequently
found in the coal formations, by the perfect preservation
of the most delicately shaped fern leaves, by the upright
position of stems, and by other appearances of a similar
character. It is also an important objection against the
universality of the cover of water, notwithstanding the
wide extent of beds of coal, that they are sometimes accompanied
with fossil remains of fresh-water shells, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
which we are entitled to draw the conclusion, that they
must have been deposited in inclosed basins of inland
waters.</p>

<p>From the beds of coal found in various situations
among <em>Alpine</em> limestone, as well as in other secondary
formations, under similar circumstances, we are at liberty
to maintain that they are not indebted for their origin
to any universal and sudden revolution.</p>

<p>When we proceed to the second division of coal formations,
to brown coal, or to <em>lignite</em>, the principal difference
we discover is, that the change which the vegetables
have undergone, having taken place at a time when
the chemical power had lost much of its energy, was incomplete;
and besides, we observe in the different
brown coal formations the same repetition of single beds
alternating with other beds of rocks, the mixture of
different minerals, and not unfrequently of upright
stems. Some appear to be derived from sea plants, and
others from fresh-water plants; but the greater proportion
from land plants. They, equally with the beds
of black coal, give evidence of a new overflow of water,
and the water plants themselves, which never thrive at a
great depth, and which frequently appear under prodigious
beds of rocks, must have experienced such a
change. But that change was scarcely of the kind which
we understand by a deluge, and the frequent repetition
of deluges indicated, according to some, by the repeated
beds of coal from the transition to the newest tertiary
periods, is hardly credible. It may be maintained,
with more certainty, of <em>brown coal</em> than of <em>black coal</em>,
that they have been formed in land water, and hence in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
limited and isolated basins of water, since fresh-water
animals are their constant attendants.</p>

<p>Although the beds of coal of our secondary formations
appear to have originated in a similar way with other
mineral formations, and not by violent catastrophes, it is
otherwise with a part of those vegetable remains which
are met with in alluvial land. Subterranean forests,
whose circumference, in some instances, extends about 70
square leagues, partly in a state of good preservation,
and partly more or less decomposed, afford satisfactory
proof of deluges, and have undoubtedly been covered up
with earth by a violent eruption of standing or running
water. But these are local effects, similar to what take
place in our own day, but on a larger scale.</p>

<p>There are abundant fossil remains of land animals, resembling
those of water animals, found in such a state of
preservation, that we cannot suppose them to have been
brought hither from distant places, and by means of currents.
Their appearing in beds of rocks, or generally in
aqueous precipitates, proves that the soil they first inhabited,
must have been dry land, afterwards overflowed
with water.</p>

<p>The appearance of what are called fresh water shells,
in alternate beds with marine animals, being sometimes
observed in newer flœtz rocks in great abundance, seems
to indicate a reiterated retreat and return of the sea.
But however meritorious the labours of naturalists,
through whom attention has been directed to the subject,
may be in other respects, we are nevertheless disposed to
entertain doubts concerning their conclusions. In our
own seas and ponds upon the coasts, we observe the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
testaceous animals growing equally well in salt water,
and in water nearly fresh; and, again, fresh water animals
living in salt water<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>. By artificial means the inhabitants
of the sea may be changed into inhabitants of
fresh water; as fresh-water animals are, in their turn,
converted into marine animals, so that, to decide concerning
the proper element of each individual species is
often matter of difficulty. Therefore, other circumstances
besides that of containing salt must be taken into
account. The occasional plenty, scarcity, or absolute
want of food; the soil being sometimes sandy, slimy, or
rocky; the depth, extent, agitation or tranquillity of the
water; and, finally, the quality of the air contained in it,
may be as instrumental in determining the habitation of
these animals, as the materials which the water holds in
solution. An excellent observer has indeed very lately
shewn in a treatise, which supports the idea of fresh-water
formations, that we possess no unerring character for distinguishing
sea shell-fish from those of fresh water; but
admitted, notwithstanding the transition above stated, we
can draw a line of distinction between them, we must not
forget that this investigation is neither regarding sea shell-fish
now existing, nor of our present waters. We indeed
draw our conclusion, and not without reason, from similar
conformation, similar modes of existence. But one of two
things must be; either that the shell-fish, whose remains
are found in beds of rocks, lived in the water out of
which these beds were precipitated, or the water in which
they lived, was dislodged by other water containing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
materials of the precipitations. In the first and more
generally admitted case, the water was so different
from the present water, whether salt or fresh, that we
cannot infer from the inhabitants of the latter any thing
concerning the inhabitants of the former; but we can
confidently maintain, that a greater resemblance prevails
between our sea and land water, than between either
the one or the other, and that fluid which was inhabited
by the shell-fish. In other respects, there remains no
other difference between fresh and salt water formations,
but that the bottom upon which the former is placed
once contained land water; a fact worthy of observation:
but the notion of enclosed basins, and of isolated formations
originating in them, the way in which fresh water
formations are supposed to have taken place, remained a
long time unsatisfactory. Finally, we may be permitted
to ask, upon what grounds they considered themselves
entitled to ascribe to the former sea the continual possession
of a portion of salt, while the salt precipitates appear
only at particular intervals, and after long interruptions?
If the sea occasionally contained a great, and sometimes
a very small, quantity of salt, it might equally be at times
altogether without it. And yet it deserves to be remembered,
that the beds of rock, to which the salt formations
are most nearly related, contain no petrifactions; that,
therefore, the so-called marine animals are wanting in
those periods during which we have any direct evidence
of the presence of salt water.</p>

<p>There is, however, a geognostic fact, which, in preference
to all others, has been cited in evidence of violent revolutions
and deluges, that is, the appearance of conglomerates
or of reproduced kinds of stone. Indeed, there might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
still be a wide field for investigation here, and more than
one formation, which now passes for sandstone, might be
acknowledged as an original and chemical production;
without having occasion to go so far as Mr Gerhard does
with greywacke,&mdash;that is, to consider them as immediate
precipitates from the atmosphere. But still conglomerates
sufficiently genuine, will remain from the transition
period through all the subsequent formations,
to serve as acknowledged monuments of destruction,
as well as of the renovation of what was destroyed.
These are the Codices rescripti, in the archives of the
Earth, out of which, the antiquarian will one day decipher
the almost obliterated traces of her former condition,
as well as the history of her changes. Though
these conglomerates deviate so much in their nature, and
in the character of their origin, from chemical productions,
they have yet among themselves this remarkable and
common characteristic, that, with few exceptions, the older
are much less varied in character, and more extensive
in distribution, than the newer, and that, at length, the
newest conglomerates become mere local appearances.
But, in reference to the main question which engages
our attention, we may conjecture that the beds of rocks
from which the sea had never retreated, might be assailed
by its floods and currents, and shattered to pieces,
as happens even in our own time, and the fragments be
again reunited into solid rocks, by means of the still remaining
dissolved matter in the water. But of many
conglomerates it is evident that they have been deposited
on the dry land, in the same way as our gravels. Jupiter,
who took counsel with himself, whether he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span>
destroy the sinful world with fire or water, and at length
decided for water<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>, may not be so justly considered the
author of these appearances, as Saturn, who devoured his
children. Or, to be less metaphorical in our language, it
may perhaps have been with the origin of conglomerates,
as it is in our own day with the origin of fragments of rock
and boulders, in which the rock being fractured in various
places by the alternations of heat and cold, by the influence
of air and atmospheric water, falls into pieces of
greater or smaller magnitude, which are carried forward
by the water, and gradually rounded in their progress,
so that they assume a more perfectly globular shape the
farther they are removed from their original situation.
Therefore, as regards the foregoing enquiry, it is not an
unimportant circumstance, that the long but continual
rolling of the boulders during their rounding, appears to
be much more efficacious than a rapid and violent impetus,
and that, in this case, as in many other geognostic
appearances, time rather than force is to be taken into
account. Another circumstance, perhaps, corresponds
with this, that the change produced by the weather, not
only by the first disunion, but also by the progressive
disintegration of the rocks, by the blunting of the edges
and corners, by the diminution of the fragments, and
generally in the origin of the boulders and fragments of
rocks of every description, has just as much influence as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span>
the mechanical operation of the water; and that a great
part of the land called Alluvial, generally owes its existence
to this cause<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>. But if, upon farther consideration,
the conglomerates appear to derive their origin in a similar
way with rolled masses of gravel, they afford evidence,
nevertheless, of the elevated station of the water
in the neighbourhood, from which they had been before
removed; for their conglomeration could take place only
under water; and, with few exceptions, they occupy an
incomparably greater elevation than any of the coal formations,
or any of the beds of rocks which enclose the
remains of land animals.</p>

<p>Geognosy certainly contains many facts, which cannot
be explained, but by a change from dry land to the bottom
of the sea, although our knowledge of them is still
so imperfect, that we cannot hazard a probable conjecture
respecting the numbers of these changes, whether
they commence at the same or at different periods
in the various quarters of the world, and whether
they are local or universal. These changes appear
neither sudden nor violent, such as we consider revolutions
of the earth, but at all times proceed with silent and
regular steps, and depend upon similar causes, concealed
it is true from us, such as the universal retreat of the
waters from their original height to the present bed of
the ocean. We do not belong to those geologists who
divert the world from its axis for the purpose of explaining
the inequalities of its surface, at whose command the
Earth sometimes opens her bosom to engulf the sea,
and at other times the floodgates of Heaven are lifted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span>
up to pour down another ocean. He who reflects on
the devastation caused by earthquakes, inundations and
the fall of mountains, even though they are merely local
appearances confined to particular quarters, cannot help
putting the question to himself, how the order, regularity
and connection exhibited by strata of rocks, could
in any measure exist, if the same or similar accidents
had happened throughout the whole world, and if mechanical
power had operated with such energy, and to such an
extent? All our knowledge of the structure of the earth,
and of the existence of its inhabitants, declares rather a
quiet uninterrupted and continually progressive advancement
in its formation and development.</p>

<p>In the lapse of geological epochs, we observe a gradation
of rock formations following one another, in which the
latter, however remotely connected, still appear sufficiently
similar to the earlier to indicate a common origin, till
they at length terminate in simple formations, resembling
those which are presently taking place. When the precipitates
were exhausted, and the structure was completed,
nay, even earlier, its destruction commenced; not
that violent destruction by which lofty mountains are
torn asunder and levelled, no uproar of nature, no gigantic
struggle of the elements, such as we commonly conceive,
but a decomposition of the strata of rocks to a greater
or less depth, caused partly by chemical, partly
by mechanical, but slow operating powers, what they
wanted in intensity being compensated by the endurance
of their operation. According to the common law of nature,
deficiency of power is supplied by duration of
time; for, of all the oracles which have been consulted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span>
concerning the formation of the earth, there is no one
which can make such important revelations to us as the
oracle of the age of mountains. These operations at the
earth’s surface generally appear to have produced its present
figure, and to have designed it for the habitation of
numerous organic beings. This appears as early as a
suitable element occurred; first, in water, then in land
animals; and, like the formation of rocks, we observe a
regular succession of organic formations, the later always
descending from the earlier, down to the present inhabitants
of the earth, and to the last created being who was
to exercise dominion over them. But here occurs this
important distinction: the organic world with youthful
vigour renews itself daily, and decomposes its materials
only to reunite them by fresh combinations in uninterrupted
succession; while the powers of the inorganic
world appear almost extinguished. Though this course
of nature is manifest to our own observation, her resources
and progress are, on the contrary, more concealed;
and we can hardly lift the veil which conceals her, unless
we follow Bacon’s advice, Turn back from rash theories,
and follow observation and experience.</p>

<p>We have hitherto endeavoured to shew that incontrovertible
geognostic facts indicate an alternate rising and
falling of the water which covered the earth’s surface,
but that they were not of a kind to justify the notion of
violent revolutions, or of sudden and universal eruptions
of the sea; and that, therefore, such deluges as the Mosaic
deluge, recorded in the traditions of nations, were
not revolutions of this description. If, according to the
supposition of Cuvier, the earth’s surface inhabited at
the commencement of the latter deluge has become the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
present bed of the sea, and the former bed of the sea has
become the present dry land, then, according to the present
state of geography, <em>though only conjectural</em>, we should be
able to point out such portions of the earth as were overwhelmed
by the catastrophe; and yet we have never
heard that any one has hazarded such an experiment.
In the constitution of the present habitable globe, we
find no proofs remaining of such a revolution.</p>

<p>Among these revolutions of nature, we never reckon
common inundations, such as take place at present from
water overflowing its boundaries, though these also may
produce devastation whose effects remain visible for an
hundred years. But, in mountainous districts, another
kind of aqueous eruption makes its appearance, and may
be classed along with the traditions of a deluge. We
very frequently, for instance, observe the valleys of high
mountains forming a range of basins separated from one
another by shorter or longer defiles, and opening through
the last defile into a wider valley, or a marsh. The
shape of these basins, or cauldrons, commonly lying above
one another like so many stories, and the level surface of
their water, leave no doubt of their being once enclosed
lakes which were formerly blocked up by the barriers of
the defiles, and which flowed towards the level country,
as soon as the defiles were broken down by the waters.
If no kind of historical monuments in the west of Europe
bears evidence of those events, which, at least on a small
scale, occur in our own times, this intimates that it was
inhabited, not by an original population, but by a foreign
or modern race of people; whereas those revolutions
extended to remote antiquity. The numerous masses of
rock found on both sides of the Alps to the height of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span>
4000 feet, as well as in the plains of the north of Europe,
at a great distance from their original position, and concerning
whose coming hither so much light has lately
been thrown by Messrs Buch and Escher, are a very
probable proof of these debacles; while every circumstance
renders it evident that these blocks were swept
along by the currents thus created, to the place where
they are now found. The Greek writers have also preserved
accounts of such revolutions, which, although not
unquestionably authenticated, are yet stamped with the
impress of historical testimony. Herodotus has the following
passages directly relative to the country where
the Greeks place their second or Deucalionic deluge.
“Thessaly must formerly have been an inland sea, surrounded
by high mountains. On the east it was bounded
by Pelios and Ossa, whose bases were united; on the
north by Olympus; on the west by Pindus; and on the
south by Othrys. Thessaly lay in the midst of these
mountains in the form of a basin, into which, in conjunction
with other copious streams, the five well-known rivers,
the Peneus, the Apidanus, the Orochomenus, the Enipeus,
and the Pamisos, emptied themselves. These rivers,
which are collected in their basin from the mountains
which encompass Thessaly, after their junction under the
name of Peneus, in which they lose their former appellation,
open towards the sea through a narrow valley.
According to tradition, this valley and opening did not
formerly exist; so that the rivers and the Lake Brebeis,
which did not formerly bear these names, having their
confluence in this place, rendered the whole of Thessaly
an inland sea. The Thessalians affirm that Neptune
opened the valley for the passage of the river Peneus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[434]</span>
and they may perhaps be right. If we consider Neptune
the author of earthquakes, and consider the violent
concussion of the mountains caused by them as the work
of this deity, we must, upon surveying these regions, confess
that they owe their present shape to him; for the separation
of every mountain appears to me to have been
produced by some violent commotion of the earth.”
Strabo makes mention of this tradition, which he thought
worthy of belief, and accounts for the origin of the Vale
of Tempe, which is the bed of the river Peneus, and
likewise for the separation of Ossa from Olympus, by
means of an earthquake<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>. In making this remark, we
perceive that our theories which allow that earthquakes
are to operate in forming the surface of the earth, have
not even the merit of novelty. According to the last
writer, similar eruptions of water must have originated in
the lake Copais in Bœotia<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>, in the lakes Bistonis and
Aphnetis, in Thrace, and have been accompanied with
huge devastation<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>. Diodorus Siculus<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> remembered a
Samothracian tradition, according to which the Euxine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span>
Sea was once shut up on all sides. It afterwards burst
through its mighty mound of <em>kyanischen</em> rocks to the Hellespont,
and inundated a great part of the coast of Asia, as
well as Samothracia itself. An objection started to the
possibility of such an event is, that, from the observations
of Olivier and General Andreossy, the shores of the
Black Sea are, in most places, lower than those of the
Bosphorus; and that its waters, therefore, even if they
were considerably higher than they are at present, would
more readily overflow the former than the latter. But
since every rock exposed for such a length of time is
daily crumbling down, it is a question, whether the
shore of the Black Sea has undergone any alteration
since that period; and we know that the eruptions
took their direction, not so much from the low situation
of the barrier, as from the nature of the rock of which
it was constructed, being influenced by the weather, and
from the rock itself being rent asunder. Be that as it
may, the words with which Diodorus commences his narrative
are remarkable, when he says, the Samothracian
deluge happened earlier than those of other nations. It
at least so far preceded others, that, in the estimation of
the Greek historian, independent of the deluges of Ogyges
and Deucalion, similar natural occurrences more or
less authenticated were received as historical facts.</p>

<p>Finally, the effects produced by the bursting of lakes
or debacles do not appear to be out of proportion to the
devastation mentioned by the traditions of nations. To
abide by our former example, floods which could carry
along with them masses of rock of 50,000 cubic feet,
were in a situation to bury a whole people; and the few
individuals who might be preserved would undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
have handed down the memory of such an event to
remote posterity. Other deluges may have arisen from
other causes, at a time when, as is shewn by numerous vestiges,
lakes and rivers had a much greater elevation than
at present; and, therefore, every overflowing of them
must have produced greater and more extensive ravages.</p>

<p>From these last local eruptions of water, that is, from
single limited districts, arose the mechanical precipitates
known under the denomination of Alluvial Soil. Their
situation, as the uppermost covering of the earth, as well
as their origin, which takes place beneath our own observation,
furnishes evidence of their being the most recent
mineral formations; and it follows from their nature and
connection that they were not produced by chemical
means, but removed by the mechanical force of water.
Since they, among other things, contain prostrate forests,
and abundant remains of land animals, we conclude
that they did not originate in the bed of the sea,
but were floated and deposited upon the dry land by an
overflow of land water. How is it conceivable that these
precipitates have been covered by the ocean, since
their deposition, and have, by means of an opposite
change, become the dry land they are at present; and
yet it must have been so, if they are to be considered
as intimations of the Mosaic deluge.</p>

<p>The view now given, which is that of Henger in his
Beiträge, is also advocated by other naturalists, and has
lately been brought forward in an interesting manner in
the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>. We have been
frequently requested to give the two views, in regard to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span>
the universal deluge, namely, that which maintains that
it is proved by an appeal to the phenomena of the mineral
kingdom; the other, which affirms that that great
event has left no traces of its existence on the surface
or in the interior of the earth. M. Cuvier’s Essay, and
Professor Buckland’s Reliquiæ, are the best authorities
for the first opinion; while numerous writers have advocated
the second.</p>

<h3 class="fs70">ON THE ACTION OF RUNNING WATERS.</h3>

<p>A very great degree of power has been attributed to
the waters which move at the surface of the earth, or in
its interior. Many geologists have advanced the opinion,
that they have scooped out the channels and even the
valleys in which they flow, and formed the cliffs whose
feet they wash; and many philosophers, naturalists and
even geologists, still support this opinion, not only in
some of its applications, but even in its whole extent.</p>

<p>In order to appreciate it, it is sufficient to observe with
care the different modes of action of water set in motion
by different causes, and the changes which it has operated
upon the rocks and deposits upon which it has acted,
from the most remote times to which history may reach.</p>

<p>We must, in the first place, successively examine the
different sorts of action of the principal masses of water
which are in motion at the surface of the earth, that is to
say, the action of torrents, of rivers, of currents of the
sea, or of great lakes, and that of waves.</p>

<p>We shall afterwards see what consequences are to be
deduced from these observations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span></p>


<h4>1. <em>Action of Torrents.</em></h4>

<p><em>Torrents</em> have a true degrading and <em>scooping</em> action
upon the earth’s surface, but, by the necessary consequence
of the sense which we attach to the word, this action
cannot be exercised upon spaces of great extent, for
a torrent is a water-course which has a great declivity.
Now, on account of the little height which the most elevated
summits of the globe have in comparison with the
extent of its surface, this action cannot be very extensive;
it can only, therefore, produce short and narrow
ravines. This action, as all who have visited high mountain
chains may have seen, is only often local and instantaneous;
it presents no remarkable effect but upon the
heaps of debris which cover the declivities of the mountains,
and on broken rocks, partially disintegrated by other
causes, and lastly on moveable deposits. The results of
this action contribute to confine it within narrower limits
still, by heaping up at the mouths of torrents in the valleys
or plains, the debris carried down by these torrents.
The elevation of the soil, which necessarily follows from
the accumulation of these debris, diminishes with the declivity,
the rapidity, and consequently the power of these
water-courses.</p>

<p>Great masses of water moving rapidly, have a marked
transporting power. Striking examples of this power
have but too often been seen in Holland, by the breaking
down of the dikes, and in Alpine mountains, in consequence
of extraordinary rains during tempests, or from
the rupture of some of the natural barriers of lakes. In
these latter times (in 1818), the Vallée de Bagne experienced
the terrible effects of this devastating power.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span>
Masses of ice having fallen towards the upper part of
this valley, and accumulated there, raised a dike sufficiently
compact and strong to block up the course of the
Dranse. The waters of this river, rapid and pent up in
certain parts of its course, as are all those of the high
Alps, accumulated above this barrier of ice, and formed
a lake which attained, at its maximum, 130 metres of
mean breadth, from 3000 to 4000 metres of length, and
36 of mean depth, and consequently a volume of water estimated
at about 29,000,000 cubic metres. Although, by
means of operations conducted with equal skill and courage,
about the third part of this volume was let off
without danger, the remaining part having suddenly
broken through the barrier of ice, was precipitated with
an almost unexampled impetuosity of 11 metres in the
second, into the Vallée de Bagne. In the first part of
its course, and in the space of half an hour which the
mass of water took in traversing a league, it carried
away trees, dwellings, enormous masses of debris, and
rocks <em>already separated from their mass</em>, as M. Escher,
expressly says; it covered all the broad parts of
the valley with rubbish, pebbles and sand, and carried
the remainder of the substances which it had swept away,
as well to the extremity of the valley, towards Martigny,
as into the bed of the Rhone. The mass of water
took an hour and a half in rushing from the glacier to
Martigny. The same event took place from the same
cause, and with nearly similar results, in 1595.</p>

<p>Torrents may therefore scoop out ravines in certain
formations, and produce effects which appear considerable,
because we judge of them by comparison with our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[440]</span>
own feeble means. But how diminutive and circumscribed
are these changes produced in the configuration of the
globe, compared with the long and broad valleys which
furrow in vast numbers the immense surface of the earth,
and to the formation of which neither the torrents nor
great rivers which exist at the present day have in any
way contributed, as we shall presently demonstrate.</p>


<h4>2. <em>Action of Rivers.</em></h4>

<p>The action of <em>rivers</em> must be examined under two
very different circumstances, or at two different parts of
their course.</p>

<p><em>First</em>, When they are compressed between mountains,
whether at no great distance from their source, or even
at the middle of their course.</p>

<p><em>Secondly</em>, When they have reached broad valleys,
whose declivity is slight, or plains which commonly surround
their mouth.</p>

<p>In the first case, these rivers partake of the impetuosity
and power of torrents. They often run with rapidity,
and in great quantity, at the bottom of narrow
and deep valleys: they are as it were inclosed in channels,
whose vertical walls appear as if cut by art. The
first idea which presents itself to all who have seen these
appearances for the first time, and who are satisfied with
first impressions, is, that these streams, which are pretty
powerful and always very impetuous, have dug these
deep grooves; and if sometimes the hardness of the rocks
and the height of the precipices which form their sides,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
appear too great for those small streams that meander at
their feet, what cannot be attributed to their immediate
power is attributed to the continued action of time.</p>

<p>Without examining how long a series of ages it would
be necessary to admit, before the rivers which we have
mentioned above, and the water-courses encased in the
deep valleys of the Alps, Pyrenees, Jura, Grampians, &amp;c.
could have scooped their valleys, on which their present
action is so slow that no one has yet been able to estimate
it; without examining if this long series of ages agrees
with the phenomena, which preclude our attributing so
remote an antiquity to the actual state of the earth’s surface,
a question of too much importance to be treated indirectly;
it will be sufficient to mention here four sorts
of observations, in order to be persuaded, or at least
to suspect, that the present rivers, even supposing
them ten times the size that they are, could not have
scooped out the deep channels at the bottom of which
they run.</p>

<p>1. We must recur to the period when the ranges of
hills which border the present valleys were not as yet
scooped out, but were united in such a manner as not
to leave any hollow between them, or merely a slight original
depression.</p>

<p>This shallowness of the valley would be accompanied
with an inconsiderable slope of its bottom. If, then, we
suppose the same mass of water, it must run with less
quickness, and consequently with much less power; and
yet a very great force must be attributed to it, before
it could have had the power of removing a portion of
rock nearly represented by a recumbent triangular prism,
having often 500 metres of breadth by a sometimes equal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
and often much greater vertical thickness. If, in order
to get rid of this difficulty, we admit a volume of water
incomparably larger than the present volume of the rivers
to which so great effects are attributed, we must admit
much more elevated and more extended mountains, to
give rise to so great a volume of water.</p>

<p>Were we only detained by this hypothesis, and did
not direct observation oppose itself to the admission of
this disaggregating power and its effect, we might pass it
over; but two other observations render the hypothesis
inadmissible.</p>

<p>2. Historical records equally concur to prove that
the rivers possessed of the greatest power which can be
attributed to them, have no appreciable corroding action
upon the rocks on which they move.</p>

<p>No one has maintained that the greater number of the
cascades, cataracts, or rapids, long known and mentioned
on account of their celebrity, have disappeared or have
even sensibly diminished, nor consequently that the natural
dike which the water had encountered in its course,
has been worn or even completely disrupted. We do
not find that cascades have changed into cataracts, and
these again into rapids. The cataracts of the Nile have
been spoken of from time immemorial, as always opposing
an obstacle to the navigation of that river; the same
is the case with those of the Danube, of the fall of the
Rhine at Schaffhausen, &amp;c. The famous cascades of the
Alps and Pyrenees have been cited ever since writing
was in use; and among all these examples we can scarcely
find two or three cascades that have been lowered, or
cataracts reduced in their level.</p>

<p>The only cascade which we can point out as having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span>
really diminished in height, is that of Tungasca in Siberia.
We do not, however, assert but that there may be
others. So many causes different from those of erosion
may concur to lower a cascade, or even make it disappear
almost entirely, that we are rather astonished at the small
number of examples mentioned, than embarrassed by the
objections which these examples might present to the
opinion which we are defending: for the fall of a part
of the rock which forms the cliff from which the cascade
is precipitated; an abundant accumulation of debris at
the foot of the cliff; a real destruction of the softer
deposits, forming part of the strata of the mountain
from which they fall, are sufficient causes for changing
the height of waterfalls. These causes must present
themselves pretty frequently; but how different is their
action from that of erosion? This, if it existed, would
extend from the source of the river to its mouth, and
would have a considerable influence upon the configuration
of the earth’s surface. Those which we have mentioned
have, on the contrary, an action so limited and so
local, as to be scarcely appreciable.</p>

<p>3. Allowing, for the moment, that a river, possessed of
a vast erosive or disaggregating power, may have scooped
out the valley in the bottom of which it at present
flows, in a state of feebleness very different from its original
state, we must account for the disposal of a vast mass
of earth and rock, which filled up the valley before the
river had removed it. It is not possible to suppose that
it has been transported into the sea, which is often
more than a hundred leagues from the valley; for
we know that when rivers, on reaching the plains, lose
their rapidity, they allow the matters to be precipi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span>tated
which they held in suspension. Besides, we have
shown that many rivers, on leaving the mountains, traverse
lakes, in which they deposit all the earthy matters
suspended in their waters. This deposition is particularly
striking in all the considerable rivers, which descend from
the ridge of the Alps toward the north-west and south-east
of that chain of mountains. These rivers meet, at the
opening of the valleys they flow through, lakes, which they
traverse, and which seem intended for their purification.
Thus, on the northern side, we see the Rhone traversing
the lake of Geneva; the Aar, the Lakes of Brientz and
Thun; the Reuss, the Lake of the Four Cantons; the
Linth, the Lake of Zurich; the Rhine, the Lake of Constance.
On the south side, the Lac Majeur is traversed
by the Tessin, the Lake of Como by the Adda, the Lake
Disco by the Oglio; the Lake of Guarda by the Mincio,
&amp;c. Now, these lakes, which are only themselves deeper
parts of the valley, would have been filled up by the
debris conveyed to the valley, if this valley had the
origin attributed to it. Proceeding from one hypothesis
to another, it might perhaps be supposed that these lakes
may have been sufficiently deep to swallow up all the debris
of the valley, without being chocked up. But, rather
than admit such suppositions, why not grant that
the same unknown cause which has scooped out the
lake, has also scooped out the valley which is only a
continuation of it?</p>

<p>4. But if facts had proved that the waters degrade the
rocks, scoop them out, and perpetually remove their debris,
we might perhaps be induced to admit that unknown
causes, of which we are absolutely ignorant, and
of which we can form no idea, have given to the original<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span>
rivers the means of surmounting all these obstacles.
Now, observation would seem absolutely to prove the
contrary.</p>

<p>We have remarked, that rapid rivers which, in
the bottom of valleys, fall in cascades, from rock to
rock, which beat with violence against the walls which
contain them, do not in any degree alter these rocks, and
that, far from corroding their surface, they allow it to be
covered with a rich coating of mosses, confervæ, &amp;c.
which could neither maintain itself, nor be formed at all,
were the least portion of the surface of these rocks continually
or even only frequently removed.</p>

<p>A much more striking fact is that which some of the
great rivers present, such as the Nile, the Orinoco, &amp;c.
which flow in the equatorial regions.</p>

<p>These powerful rivers, when they have arrived at
places where they are contracted, and, as it were, jammed
in between two rocky walls, form impetuous cataracts.
Their waters, endowed by the celerity of this fall
with the greatest erosive power that can be attributed
to this fluid, must necessarily have corroded, or at least
worn, the rocks which they have thus beat against
since the creation of our present Continent. Now, so far
from removing the surface, they cover it with a brownish
varnish of a peculiar nature.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, well established, that water <em>alone</em>
does not scoop those rocks, whose aggregation is complete,
or which are solid; and that it does not wear them in
any way, whatever be its quantity of motion.</p>

<p>We say <em>water alone</em>; and we must insist on this distinction,
in order to make the preceding facts agree with
other facts, which might seem contradictory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[446]</span></p>

<p>We often see furrows scooped out on the walls
that bound the narrows of rivers; we also see rocks
rounded, and entirely destitute of moss. But let the
facts be examined with attention, and we shall find
that this erosion always takes place in the parts of their
course, where, on account of the nature of the neighbouring
soil, the torrents carry with them, in their risings (or
floods), debris and detached stones from their banks;
and it is by means of these stones that they wear the
rocks which are in their bed.</p>

<p>It is very easy to appreciate these circumstances. It
is remarked, that this erosion has never taken place
at the sources of powerful springs. All the pebbles
which had to be carried off have been so long ago,
and the mosses which grow abundantly on the rocks
at the level of the water, and in the bed of these torrents,
have nothing more to fear from the destructive action of
these solid bodies. The case is the same with the parts
which immediately succeed a lake, or a great excavation,
capable of arresting all the hard bodies carried off by the
river. There the mosses appear in abundance; because
they are not subjected to the action of any other substance
than of the water alone.</p>

<p>The present rivers do not therefore appear to have
any erosive power upon the rocks which are completely
aggregated, when they act by themselves, and when no
other cause, such as frost, decomposition, &amp;c. has disintegrated
the rock. The absence of these foreign circumstances
is proved by the vegetation or the enamel which
then cover the rocks exposed to the action of the water.</p>

<p>These rivers, in proportion as they remove from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[447]</span>
rocks in the neighbourhood of the lofty mountains in
which they took their rise, often gain in volume what
they have lost in velocity; but the power dependent upon
size rarely compensates that which they owed to rapidity;
and although these large rivers still retain a
transporting power, sufficient to carry along with them
the obstacles which oppose themselves to their progress,
they are far from presenting results of action so striking
as those of torrents. They stir up, when flooded, or
when they change place, the earth and mobile sand which
cover their bottom, especially towards their edges, and
transport them to some distance; but they scarcely move
pebbles larger than an egg, which occur in their bed,
and which have been brought there in other times, and
under other circumstances. On thus transporting the
comminuted and mobile mineral matters, they deposite
them again in places where their current is relaxed by
some cause, and thus raise the bottom of their bed in
these places; they seek a new passage in the midst of
the barriers which they have themselves constructed.
The principal current is then borne, sometimes against
one bank, and sometimes against the other; and when it
comes to beat upon the foot of a steep part, composed
of moveable soil, as the banks commonly are, in such
cases, they really erode it, and make it fall into the river;
and transport to another part of its course, the earth resulting
from the destruction of the bank, and give rise
to new obstacles. Hence the new deposites, which border
rivers in all points where their current is slackened,
and principally toward their mouth. It is sufficient for
our present purpose to have referred to facts remarkable
for their number, for the importance which they have had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448"></a>[448]</span>
in regard to the modern changes of the configuration of the
globe; and, lastly, in regard to agriculture and civilisation;&mdash;facts
of easy observation, and which tend to prove, that
the action of rivers, whose fall is not sufficiently rapid
to entitle them to be considered as torrents, is not to
scoop out their bed, either in the valleys or in the plains
through which they flow, but rather to raise them, and
to tend, consequently, rather to level and flatten the
earth than to furrow it, more than it has been since the
Continents have assumed the configuration which they
now possess.</p>

<p>But if we have not been able to recognise a real corroding
power in the great rivers falling in the form of
cascades or cataracts, let us inquire elsewhere, in circumstances
where the water seems endowed with a still superior
power, what are the effects of this agent?</p>


<h4>3. <em>Action of Waves.</em></h4>

<p>It is in the sea, an enormous mass, sometimes acquiring,
from the action of the winds, an incalculable power,
that we must find the maximum of force of the water of
the <em>present</em> times. In fact, in this case, the power of
transportation is so prodigious, that the strongest barriers,
both natural and artificial, are overturned, and the
largest stones, together with enormous fragments of rocks
torn from their place, transported, and even projected to
a distance. But it is to these effects that this immeasurable
power is limited. The water, which displaces
and transports to a distance these heavy masses, does<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[449]</span>
not abrade the surface when it acts by itself. We see this
surface, on rocks and the sides of piers and dikes, perpetually
beaten by the waves, covered with fuci, confervæ,
byssi, and other delicate vegetables, <em>without roots</em>,
which the waves have not prevented from contracting
a first and feeble adherence, and which they do not
hinder from growing. But, if the waves carry with them
pebbles, or even sand, it is those hard bodies which act;
the surface of the rocks is abraded, and all vegetation
ceases.</p>

<p>The same effect takes place, and is even augmented
by the real degradation of the coasts, if the sea acts upon
friable rocks, capable of mixing with water, such as
argillaceous or calcareous marl, or chalk, or upon rocks
which are hard, but naturally fissured, or partly disaggregated,
such as certain granites; it then easily removes
the crumbled or previously detached parts, scoops out
the foot of the rock or steep coast, and causes the upper
part, which is deprived of support, to fall. But, in consequence
of this fall, it forms a slope, which, by its inclination,
deadens the violence of the shock, and even
protects the foot of the cliff, for some time only, if it be
friable, or capable of disintegration; and for ever, if,
being compact, it does not carry in it the causes of destruction.
The action of the waves ceasing, the slope is covered
with vegetation; and if the coast continues, nevertheless,
to be worn, the changes are then owing to
causes unconnected with the action of water.</p>

<p>Such is, in few words, the ordinary action of the water
of the sea upon steep coasts, and even that of great
masses of water in a state of agitation. M. De Luc, in
his various works, has estimated this action with a cor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[450]</span>rectness
of observation and of reasoning, which is remarkable
only, because it has not been adopted by all
naturalists; and few have bestowed the unremitting attention
upon the subject which this respectable geologist
has done. He has shewn, that the destructive action of
the waters upon steep shores, and other coasts or abrupt
cliffs, was considerably restrained by the very consequences
of this action; that the debris which accumulated
protected the lower parts of these coasts from the
action of the water, or gradually reduced an abrupt coast
to a very inclined and permanent slope.</p>

<p>Next, to <em>torrents</em>, to rapid and large <em>rivers</em>, and to
<em>waves</em>, it is to <em>currents</em> that a great influence on the
earth’s surface has been attributed,&mdash;an influence which
a highly gifted naturalist, Buffon, has employed to explain
all the inequalities of the earth’s surface.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the action of currents is less precise
than that which we possess of rivers. But if we cannot
so visibly demonstrate that, in no circumstance similar to
those which we have specified, do they scoop out the
bottom of the sea into valleys, nor form any mountains,
we can, at least, conjecture with much probability, and
maintain, that we have no direct and constant proof of
that action.</p>


<h4>4. <em>Action of Currents.</em></h4>

<p>No one doubts that currents, near coasts, heap up
upon the beach, at the mouth of rivers and harbours,
pebbles, sand, gravel, mud, or other transportable matters,
whether these currents constantly exist, or simply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451"></a>[451]</span>
result from the momentary action of a predominating
wind; but this action, although already limited to the
mobile matters which form the bottom of the sea only in
some parts, whether this action, I say, extends to a great
depth, that is to several hundred yards, is a question
not yet resolved. In the first place, the observation
made by mariners, that, in the most violent tempests,
the sea is only agitated towards the coasts, or on shallows,
and that bodies, sunk to a great depth, (and still
what is this depth in comparison with that of the sea,)
do not feel the motions of its surface, nor that of currents;
and, secondly, reasoning, and even calculation,
according to Messieurs La Place and Poisson, concur to
shew, that the violent motions of the waters of the sea
are not propagated to a great depth. It is therefore
probable, that all the transportable matters, which are at
this depth, must remain nearly in the position in which
they are, since our Continents have assumed their present
configuration, unless phenomena and motions of the
sea take place at the bottom, of which we are ignorant, and
which are foreign to the subject which at present occupies
our attention.</p>

<p>But if we have no perfectly certain ideas regarding
the propagation of the motions of the sea in depth, we
can assert, that, whatever that extent and that power
may be, the submarine currents no more abrade the
rocks than rivers do the surface of the land. This proof
is always derived from the same kind of fact, namely,
from the vegetable and animal bodies which constantly
cover the rocks, and which are found, at all times, by
means of various sorts of dredge-fishing. In fact, no one
has remarked, that the places in which oysters, mussels,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452"></a>[452]</span>
corals and sponges are fished, are more sheltered from
currents than others; nor that these places, after violent
tempests, have been deprived, and consequently, as it
were, despoiled of those productions, which, by covering
the rocks, demonstrate that they preserve the integrity
of their surface. Many of these bodies, however, as
sponges, fuci and confervæ, contract but a feeble adherence
to the bodies upon which they are placed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It therefore appears, if not completely proved, at least
extremely probable, from the facts and reasonings which
we have related,</p>

<p>1. That the <em>presently existing</em> waters, that is to say,
in the state of purity in which we are acquainted with
them, have no erosive action upon rocks, whatever be
the nature of these rocks, when, 1st, The rocks are completely
solid, and when they are neither friable nor disintegrated;
2d, When these waters act by themselves, that
is to say, when their action is not complicated with the
really erosive action of solid bodies, such as pebbles,
sand, and perhaps even pieces of ice.</p>

<p>2. That water, sometimes acquiring, on account of its
quality and velocity, a great transporting power, may
remove masses, already detached, and of great size, according
to its degree of velocity, and the bulk of its mass,
and so far as it preserves this same power.</p>

<p>3. That the presently existing waters may have attacked,
undermined, and caused to fall down, portions
of solid and steep rocks, by mixing with beds of clay,
marl, and sand, interposed between their solid strata;
that they may also, in their rapid falls, have scooped
pretty deep ravines in very inclined deposites, consisting
of disintegrated rocks; but that these waters could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a>[453]</span>
have scooped out, either by a violent action, or by a
slow one, however long continued, any of those long and
broad longitudinal depressions, which are named valleys,
or of those narrow openings, with almost vertical walls,
which are named <em>gorges</em> or ravines.</p>

<p>4. That, even when the deposites, which border these
valleys or these ravines, are composed of transportable
matter, the waters which at present flow in them could
not have scooped them out, even supposing them to have
been much larger in some than they now are; the declivity
of the present deposite not being sufficiently great
to give to these masses of water the rapidity necessary
for producing this effect, and a power sufficient for carrying
off the moveable matters which filled the valley or
gorge.</p>

<p>5. Lastly, that the present running waters, so far
from having contributed to form the numerous valleys,
glens, gorges and ravines, continually tend to fill them
up, and rather to level the surface of the globe than
to furrow it, more deeply than it is.</p>

<h3><em>On the Connection of Geology with Agriculture and
Planting<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>.</em></h3>

<p>That all sorts of soils are not equally adapted to all
productions, is a remark of Virgil’s, the truth of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454"></a>[454]</span>
becomes obvious, when we consider many facts ascertained
in Agriculture and Forestry. If, therefore, as the poet
advises, our object be to determine what each particular
region can produce, and what it cannot, our attention
ought in the first place to be directed to the physical circumstances
which exert their influence over vegetation.</p>

<p>All plants that are the subject of cultivation are fixed
in the ground. By one of their parts, through which
they derive their principal nourishment, they penetrate
into the soil, which serves them as a basis, and affords
them the means of procuring subsistence; by the other
part they raise themselves into the atmosphere, which is
not only necessary in itself for their existence, but is also
the medium through which they derive the warming and
vivifying influence of the solar rays. Hence we can understand
how much the existence of plants must be influenced
by differences in the condition of the soil and
air.</p>

<p>The superficial crust of the globe is formed of soil capable
of producing vegetables. This productive soil,
however, is not everywhere continuous, being interrupted
on the one hand by the watery covering of
the earth, and on the other by perennial snow and bare
rock. Where soil does occur, it separates the solid
mass of the earth from the atmosphere, and is the porous
medium through which the gaseous and watery
parts of the latter may act in a greater or less degree
upon the former. It is very seldom that strata of vege<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455"></a>[455]</span>table
soil lie beneath strata of other matters; and where
they occur in this position, the overlying strata are either
of volcanic or of alluvial origin. Of the former case, a
very remarkable example occurs in the Isle of Bourbon,
in which large tracts covered with vegetables and even
trees, have been laid waste and overwhelmed by streams
of lava; and large rivers in their overflowings occasionally
leave deposits of various characters, over the productive
soil containing remains of formerly existing plants.</p>

<p>Productive soil, as well in regard to its <em>situation</em> as to
its <em>constitution</em>, depends upon the nature and condition
of the rocks which form the solid mass of the
earth. It is always of secondary formation, compared
with the rock on which it rests, its principal parts usually
originating from the decomposition of this rock. While
the forms of the surface of the solid mass of the earth,
have much influence upon the action of the atmosphere,
they also in some degree modify that of climate. From
these circumstances it would appear that the solid substrata
of productive soil exert an influence in various
ways upon vegetables; whence it follows that, in order
to obtain a more intimate knowledge of the conditions
which operate upon their existence, it is necessary to call
in geology to our assistance.</p>

<p>Although the scientific study of agriculture has made
great progress in our times, the relations which exist between
the constitution of the solid crust of the earth,
and the formation and nature of vegetable soil, present a
wide field for investigation. Geologists have hitherto
too much neglected the examination of the productive
covering of the earth, and those who have treated scien<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456"></a>[456]</span>tifically
of agriculture and forestry have usually looked
upon the vegetable soil in its own simple capacity, without
regard to its foundation and origin. To point out
the way by which we are to proceed in our investigation
of the relations which exist between the solid crust of
the earth and the productive soil which covers it, is the
principal object of the following observations.</p>

<p>Bare rocks cannot be made subservient to the purposes
of agriculture. Lichens indeed, cover the surface of
rocks, deriving their chief nutriment from the atmosphere;
mosses draw the water necessary for their subsistence
from the fissures of stones; the roots of grasses
seek in the chinks of rocks for particles of earth sufficient
for their sustenance; various shrubs and trees penetrate
here and there into rocky masses by their roots (having
the powerful and continued action of living wedges),
where the cohesion of the parts is smallest, in order to
prepare a fixed seat for themselves, and be secure from
the pernicious effects of the atmosphere. The surface
of the earth is always sterile, however, when it shows a
continuity of naked rock, uncovered by vegetable mould.
The cultivation of fields and woods, and even the rearing
of cattle, cannot therefore find scope in regions which
are entirely rocky. Abrupt and precipitous mountains
being generally in this condition are usually barren; but
in plains and on declivities, a bare rocky surface is much
less frequently the cause of sterility than an unfavourable
proportion of mould. Some rocky and moderately elevated
regions also occur, more or less destitute of vegetable
mould, whose sterility depends upon volcanic causes.
Iceland, for example, affords cases of this descrip<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[457]</span>tion.
In many parts of Sweden, as in Westrogothia, in
Scotland, &amp;c., there occur many elevated regions, in
which gneiss and granite predominating, exclude to a
great extent all kinds of vegetation excepting lichens.
In the same districts we sometimes meet with pastures
and corn-fields interrupted here and there by bare rocks
rising but little above the surface, by which the value of
the ground is much diminished, and great impediments
opposed to its cultivation.</p>

<p>As bare rocks are incapable of all cultivation, their distance
from the under surface of vegetable mould must
also be of great importance. In the plains of the north of
Germany, for example, this distance is often so great
that a rocky surface is never found, while, on the contrary,
in other countries, especially such as are mountainous,
the roots of plants not unfrequently touch the subjacent
rock; the variation between these extremes being of all
degrees. The effect of the distance of the surface of the
solid rock from the under surface of productive soil may
be both <em>direct</em> and <em>indirect</em>, and may vary much, not
only with reference to the species of rock, but also to
the vegetables.</p>

<p>The surface of the solid strata of the earth has a <em>direct</em>
influence upon the cultivation of plants, because it
terminates the extension of their roots, and limits the
volume of the soil necessary for their sustenance. As the
length and direction of the roots vary exceedingly in different
species, the difference of effect with regard to their
growth, and the approximation of the rock to the under
surface of the soil, must in general be so much the less
prejudicial in proportion as the roots decline from the
perpendicular; whence it follows, that certain grasses, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458"></a>[458]</span>
some small pasture plants, may grow in very thin layers
of soil, where the larger grasses and pasture plants with
longer roots, could not find subsistence; and that shrubs
and trees, with long perpendicular roots, cannot survive in
many places, where others with more horizontal roots
may thrive. These inferences are proved to be correct
by observations in agriculture and forestry generally
known.</p>

<p>Mountainous regions, which are not so elevated but
that corn might grow sufficiently well in them, in so far
as depends upon the conditions of the air or climate, are
yet frequently not adapted for its cultivation, on account
of the too near approach of the rock to the surface, or
shallowness of the soil, and produce nothing but grasses,
and some other pasture plants, among which, however,
there is the greatest difference in this respect. <em>Trifolium
montanum</em>, for example, can support itself on rocky
mountains, where <em>T. pratense</em> could not grow. <em>Hedysarum
onobrychis</em> grows luxuriantly on the sunny declivities
of calcareous mountains, where <em>Medicago sativa</em>
(Lucern) does not find a suitable station. The cultivation
of this excellent pasture plant in some mountainous
regions, especially where the rocks are calcareous,
has not proved so advantageous as might have been expected,
because the plants have died out in the course of
a few years; whereas, in proper places, where its very
long roots find a sufficient depth of soil, they usually
last for a great length of time.</p>

<p>The vicinity of the rock to the under surface of the vegetable
mould, or the shallowness of the soil, seems to be
the principal cause why the <em>Beech</em> grows better on many
calcareous mountains than the <em>Oak</em>, which, on the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459"></a>[459]</span>
hand, finds a fitter station on mountains in which sandstone
predominates, where the soil is usually deeper.
It would seem to be for a similar reason that the <em>Beech</em>
grows in many rocky districts, for example, on the
Hartz Mountains, at pretty considerable heights, especially
on the sides of valleys which run to the south,
while these places do not admit the <em>Oak</em>, which is found
in the middle provinces of Sweden and Norway; while
the Beech, on the other hand, grows only in the southern
parts. From the deficiency of soil, the Upper Hartz can
produce neither the <em>Pinus pinea</em>, nor <em>P. sylvestris</em>; the
horizontal roots, however, of the <em>Abies</em>, or Norway Spruce,
are content with the small portion of earth which covers
the greywacke and slate, although they cannot find
sufficient hold to protect its lofty trunks from being
thrown down by the tempest. In some parts of the Forest
of Thuringia, where the covering of loose earth is deeper
than in the Hartz, the <em>Pinus picea</em>, or pitch pine,
grows luxuriantly. The common fir, <em>Pinus sylvestris</em>,
which attains a great height in proper soil, on the contrary,
is stunted and distorted on rocky mountains,
where the roots soon come in contact with the rock. It
there loses the character of a tree, and assumes that of a
shrub, as in place of a single upright stem, several
branches shoot out, and these, not unfrequently, are
creeping or bent.</p>

<p>The different conditions of rocks, especially their structure
and their state of cohesion, are of some importance in
producing these effects; for the surface of rocks must be
detrimental or impervious to the roots of plants, in proportion
to the compactness of their structure, and the cohesion
of their parts. Schistose rocks, for example, af<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460"></a>[460]</span>ford
a more easy passage to roots, than granular crystalline
ones; pure quartz resists the roots of plants in the
highest degree; sandstone much less; and pure limestone,
on account of its comparatively small number of fissures,
is much less favourable to vegetation than marl, chalk,
or slightly cohering calcareous rocks, the masses of which
are usually split in all directions.</p>

<p>The direction and inclination of the strata have also
some influence in this matter; for, in proportion as the
principal fissures of the strata are, from their direction
or inclination, more readily presented to the roots of vegetables,
the less prejudicial will their surface be to vegetation.
Horizontal strata, therefore, are the least favourable
to vegetation, perpendicular ones the most.
In the inclination of strata intermediate in some degree
between these positions, the roots of vegetables will find
a greater obstacle on the side of a hill in which the surface
of a stratum is opposed to them, than on the other,
in which the principal fissures of the strata are open.
The effects of this circumstance may frequently be observed
in mountainous tracts having two principal inclinations,
the state of vegetation, and especially the growth
of wood, being more prosperous on the one of these declivities
than on the other.</p>

<p>The surface of the solid strata of the earth may also
have an <em>indirect influence</em> upon the cultivation of vegetables.
The various <em>inclinations of this surface</em> deserve
first to be considered, being of the greatest effect with
regard to fixing the fertile soil. The horizontal position
of a rocky surface is in the highest degree favourable to
the stability of vegetable earth; and the greater its angle
of inclination, the greater is the danger of its losing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461"></a>[461]</span>
the soil upon it. In a highly inclined plane, the imperfect
support of the centre of gravity is the sole cause of the
loss of earth; in a less inclined plane the diminution of
soil is usually caused by water, which produces this effect
in a greater or less degree, according to the difference
of inclination. In both these modes, by which a removal
of soil is produced, the effect may be modified by
a difference in the condition of the loose earth, as not
only its stability as to situation, but also its resistance
to the power of water, vary according to the size, figure,
and cohesion of the parts, as well as their adhesion
to the surface of the rock. Sandy loose soils, for example,
are more liable to transposition than marly or
loamy ones; and these, again, are more easily moved
than such as are clayey and adhesive.</p>

<p>Whatever be the nature of the soil, a small degree of
inclination in the solid rock is sufficient to favour its denudation
by the removal of the former; and the inclinations
of the surfaces of rocks having a covering of earth
and vegetation, are in reality much less considerable
than we usually suppose them to be, judging merely by
the eye. The celebrated Humboldt has published observations
on this subject. According to his measurements,
<ins class="corr" id="tn-461" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'a slop of even'">
a slope of even</ins> fifteen degrees appears steep, and
a declivity of thirty-seven degrees is so abrupt, that if it
be covered with a dense sward, it can scarcely be climbed.
The inclination of the pastures of the Alps seldom exceeds
an angle of ten or fifteen degrees, and a slope
of twenty degrees is pretty steep. At an inclination of
forty degrees, the surface of the rock is sometimes covered
with earth bearing a sward, but at a greater inclination
the rocks are usually destitute of soil and vegetation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462"></a>[462]</span>
In the Upper Hartz, the most common inclination of
the declivities of the mountains is twenty-five degrees;
nor does it usually exceed thirty-three, at which inclination
the <em>beech</em> and <em>spruce</em> grow. The greatest declivities
at which ground can be advantageously cultivated
have an inclination of thirty degrees.</p>

<p>The roots of vegetables, especially of grasses, shrubs,
and trees, are of much importance in supporting the
earth upon the declivities of rocks. Care must therefore
be taken that the declivities of mountains which are covered
with turf or wood, be not altogether deprived of
these coverings, as sometimes happens in consequence of
loosening the turf for agricultural purposes, or of incautiously
extirpating the wood. In Norway, near Roraas,
there occur mountains, destitute of all vegetation, that
had formerly been covered with woods, but where now,
from the deficiency of soil, no seeds could take root.
The same is the case in many parts of the Alps, where,
from the irregular long-continued removal of the timber,
the sides of mountains which were formerly covered
with thick woods, now show nothing but naked rocks.
For this reason, in mountainous countries with very steep
declivities, the breeding of cattle and planting of woods
are often more advantageous than agriculture. In France
the greatest inclination of the public roads is limited by
law to an angle of four degrees and forty-six minutes:
a similar restriction with regard to agriculture might
not be without benefit in certain mountainous countries.</p>

<p>The inclinations of the surface of the solid crust of
the earth vary much, according to the different qualities
of the rocks; some having a tendency to form abrupt
precipices, others, again, to produce gentle declivities.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a>[463]</span>
For this reason, mountains consisting of quartz or porphyry,
for example, very frequently present surfaces destitute
of vegetation; while, on the other hand, those of
granite, slate or sandstone, are more frequently adapted
for agriculture and planting. In the northern parts of
Scotland, quartz rocks, destitute of all vegetation, rise
in the midst of mountains covered with gramineous plants,
and sometimes wood. In the most fertile part of the
south of Norway porphyritic mountains rise from a calcareous
and schistose base, with lofty, rugged, and bare
cliffs. In the southern parts of the Tyrol the rocky sterility
of the abrupt and lofty porphyritic mountains presents
a striking contrast to the fertility of the neighbouring
limestone mountains, which are covered with vines,
walnuts and chesnuts.</p>

<p>The <em>surface</em> of the solid strata of the earth has also an
indirect influence upon the cultivation of plants, in so
far as the water which the vegetable mould acquires
from the atmosphere, is retained in the soil, or is drawn
off by the subjacent rock. Different rocks produce very
different effects in this respect, depending as well upon
their constitution as their structure. The component
parts of rocks imbibe water in different modes and degrees;
and different sorts of rocks not only attract water
with different celerity, but also imbibe different quantities
of it. The latter difference depends chiefly upon
the various substances of which rocks are composed,
partly, also, upon their porosity. Siliceous rocks attract
water in the lowest degree, argillaceous ones in the highest,
and calcareous rocks appear to have an intermediate
action in this respect. Compact and granular crystalline
rocks attract water in a smaller degree, and more
slowly; friable or crumbled rocks imbibe it in greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464"></a>[464]</span>
quantity, and with more celerity than those which are
not disintegrated. The condition of rocks with regard
to the attraction of water, affects, in a different manner,
the humidity of soil; for, by this attraction, moisture
may as well be abstracted from, as imparted to, the loose
earth or soil by which rocks are covered. Part of the
moisture which vegetable earth or soil derives from the
atmosphere passes into the subjacent mass of rock, but
this may again be compensated by evaporation; on which
account the soil of such rocks as have but a small attraction
for water usually dries up more readily than soils
whose solid substratum attracts and retains the moisture
in a greater degree.</p>

<p>It is probable that the structure of rocks has also a
greater, and not less, diversified influence upon the humidity
of productive soil. Solid rocks, which are not
traversed by numerous perpendicular fissures penetrating
to a considerable depth, allow the water to remain
in the soil; but columnar and schistose rocks, with perpendicular
fissures, and strata declined from the horizontal
position, draw off the water from the soil covering
their surface, into lower places, where it often
re-appears under the form of springs. In these circumstances,
we find a partial explanation of the great difference
between the humidity of soil covering a surface of
solid granite, and that lying upon limestone, which is
intersected by numerous fissures. Granitic mountains
are often furnished with marshes, whereas, on the other
hand, the dryness of the soil upon calcareous mountains
is generally excessive<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>, the cause of which phenomenon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465"></a>[465]</span>
is, in a great measure, to be attributed to the circumstances
above mentioned. Columella observes, that silex
having a moderate covering of earth, preserves to the
latter its humidity; and Palladius repeats the remark.
In districts which consist of quartzose rocks, not less
than of granitic ones, the surface is often covered with
marshes. Porphyritic rocks, on the contrary, which
have a remarkable segregation of parts, as well as columnar
basalt, let off the water to lower places. Springs
are very frequently found at the bottom of basaltic mountains;
for the atmospheric waters penetrate by the perpendicular
fissures to the strata on which the basalt rests,
and appear at the place where the two rocks meet.</p>

<p>The effect of different rocks upon the preservation and
diminution of the moisture of fertile soil, influences vegetation
in various degrees. The retentive power of the
surface of rocks is of the greatest importance, where the
soil consists chiefly of sand, through which the water
percolates, and passes off entirely, unless it meets with a
stratum of such a nature, as to obstruct its passage, or
comes upon a surface of solid rock. The cause of the
sterility of sandy plains is not merely their sandy nature,
but also the great depth of the mass or rock capable of retaining
the water. The same sand, when covering mountains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466"></a>[466]</span>
consisting of sandstone, has a much less degree of
sterility than in those plains, because the surface of the
subjacent rock impedes the progress of the water, and
consequently retains it in the soil<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>. It has been sufficiently
proved by experiments, that plants can grow in
pure sand, when furnished with the necessary quantity of
water. A subjacent rocky surface has an entirely different
effect upon soil which is very retentive of moisture, upon
a clay soil for example, as, in that case, the humidity is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467"></a>[467]</span>
increased to a prejudicial degree. In land of this nature,
a substratum of rock having the property of drawing off
the water would be useful.</p>

<p>The different conditions of rocks with regard to caloric,
may have some indirect influence upon the vigour of
plants. Heat, whether imparted to the vegetable soil by
the sun’s rays, or generated by various chemical processes
in the earth itself, penetrates to the surface of the subjacent
rocks, and is more or less drawn from it in a longer
or shorter time. Columella observes, that rocks in
the upper part of the soil are prejudicial to vines and
trees, but in the lower part cool them. The heat of
soil will be more or less drawn from it, according to
the greater or less conducting power of the subjacent
rock. Compact crystalline rocks are probably better
conductors of caloric than those which are of looser texture;
siliceous rocks than argillaceous and calcareous
ones. The influence of the subjacent rock must be
greater in this respect, in proportion to the thinness of
the superincumbent soil. The effect of the abduction
of caloric is more particularly sensible, where the roots
of cultivated plants touch the rock, a circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468"></a>[468]</span>
which we often see in vineyards. The vine frequently
thrives remarkably on the declivities of mountains, in
which it sends its roots among fragments of stones. Experience
shows, that the quality of wine is influenced by
the different conditions of the stones, among which vines
are planted. Albertus Magnus has observed, that the
vine thrives well in earth which is mixed with fragments
of black roofing slate; and Humboldt remarks, that the
vines which grow upon the mountains of the valley of
the Rhine, consisting of black clay-slate, afford an excellent
wine. At the Cape of Good Hope, also, the vine
thrives well in a soil produced by the decomposition of
clay-slate, and mixed with fragments of it<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>. It is probable,
that the adaptation of this sort of soil to the cultivation
of the vine, depends upon its slow conducting
power, and upon its rapidly imbibing the rays of the sun,
on account of its dark colour, and thus increasing the
heat of the ground.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have only spoken of the <em>proximate</em> influence
of rocks upon plants; but it cannot be denied,
that the <em>remote</em> effects which they produce, (inasmuch as
vegetable soil is derived from them, and, therefore, the
qualities of this soil depend in a great measure upon their
nature,) are of greater importance.</p>

<p>It is from the rocks which constitute the crust of the
earth, that the principal portion of productive soil is derived.
Although other substances belonging to the animal
and vegetable kingdoms, are necessary for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469"></a>[469]</span>
nourishment of plants, a soil consisting chiefly of inorganic
particles is still more necessary, both for sustaining
their roots, and for receiving, retaining, and partly also
preparing nutrition for them; for, according to accurate
observations, some inorganic substances exert an influence
upon the decomposition of animal and vegetable remains.
These effects vary much according to differences
in the aggregation and chemical nature of the inorganic
parts; of which circumstances, however, the different qualities
of rocks are the ultimate cause.</p>

<p>Two kinds of productive soil may be distinguished
with regard to their origin. The soil has either originated
in the place in which it now is from the subjacent rock,
or it has been transported to the places in which it is now
found by some power, especially by that of water. The
first kind may be named <em>untransported</em>, the second <em>transported
soil</em>. To the first kind of soil is to be referred a
great part of the soil which covers the summits and declivities
of mountains, and to the other, the soil which
fills the bottoms of valleys, as well as a great part of the
loose soil of extensive strata in hilly countries and plains.
Untransported soil is generally thinner than the transported;
and of the two the latter is that which most frequently
occurs in low land. The first kind of soil, the
untransported, is found to be more or less similar, in
its principal constituent parts, to the rocks from which
it has originated; in the other kind, the transported
soil, on the contrary, the parts which were originally in
connection, have been variously separated and mixed, by
the agency of the powers by which its transportation was
effected.</p>

<p>The quantity and quality of the soil derived from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470"></a>[470]</span>
the disintegration of rocks, must depend upon the nature
of these rocks; its quality being determined by
the constituent parts of the rock from which it originated,
and its quantity being proportioned to the greater
or less degree in which the rock may resist decomposition.</p>

<p>The disintegration of rocks, and their conversion into
loose earth, are partly <em>mechanical</em>, and partly <em>chemical</em>.
The principal mechanical powers, by which disintegration
is effected, are, <em>1st</em>, The weight of the loosened
parts; <em>2d</em>, Water, not merely in its liquid and mobile
state, but also, and that chiefly, in the state of ice; <em>3d</em>,
The roots of vegetables in general, and especially of trees.
These powers usually act more or less in conjunction,
and the effects produced by this union are in many
cases almost incredible.</p>

<p>The disintegration of rocks commences in those parts
where the power of cohesion is least energetic. Rents
take place owing to the unequal attraction of parts, and
also in the direction of planes, in which heterogeneous
parts are in contact; and in this manner the original
structure of rocks determines the first steps of their disintegration.
Water, which enters into the minute fissures
of rocks, by the power of capillary attraction, is expanded
by congelation, and thus overcomes the cohesion
of parts, and produces rents. The roots of trees acting
as wedges, produce the same effect in a wonderful degree,
a phenomenon which has been so well illustrated
by Annæus Seneca, in his Natural Questions. “Let us
consider,” says he, “how great a power is exerted by the
most minute seeds, which, although at first small as they
are, can scarcely find a place in the crevices of rocks, yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471"></a>[471]</span>
at length grow to such a size as to rend asunder vast
rocks, overturning crags and cliffs, by the power of their
very minute and delicate roots.” The parts of rocks
loosened by these powers, are entirely separated, and are
carried to a great or less distance, by streams of water,
and in the higher regions, by the power of winds. In
cliffs and precipices which have been formed by the splitting
of masses of rock, effected in the manner above
described, the loosened parts often lose their stability;
and, following the direction of gravity, fall to the
ground, an effect which has also been described by Seneca
in another place. “Nor is it alone probable,”
says he, “that rocks are split asunder by their mere
weight, but also when streams of water are carried over
them, the continual moisture works into the joinings of
the rock, and daily takes away a portion of the connecting
matter, and, if I may so speak, abrades the skin by
which it is contained. At length, in the course of ages,
this gradual detrition so much diminishes the supporting
parts, that they can no longer sustain the weight. Then
masses of vast size fall down, and the rock tumbling
from its ancient seat, overwhelms whatever lies below.”
The cohesion of some rocks, especially argillaceous ones,
is so slight, and their porosity so great, that their smallest
parts imbibe water, and are sensibly softened by it,
an effect which is much assisted by the freezing of the
water. This mechanical change is experienced by the different
varieties of common clay, slate-clay, and some
other rocks.</p>

<p><em>Chemical</em> powers often act in conjunction with mechanical
ones, in breaking down rocks, the former, the chemical,
frequently finishing what had been begun by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472"></a>[472]</span>
latter. Mechanical powers only changing the <em>aggregation</em>
of rocks, may break down their parts to a certain
size, according to their different nature; chemical powers,
again, which change the <em>nature</em> of substances, destroy
the connection of the minute parts of rocks. When chemical
is preceded by mechanical action, it is much assisted
by it. The latter has a much more general effect,
as all rocks are subjected to its influence; chemical decomposition,
on the other hand, acts only upon some
rocks, and in these only upon certain parts. The chemical
decomposition of rocks is chiefly effected by the
oxygen of atmospheric air and of water; but we are also
persuaded, that certain cryptogamic plants, intimately
attached to the surface of stones, Lichens namely, assist
in their destruction.</p>

<p>The oxygen of air and water can only affect the constituent
parts of rocks, which have a great affinity to
it, such as the iron and sulphur forming pyrites, oxydulous
iron, oxydulous manganese, or the same substances
mixed with earth or carbonic acid, charcoal and bitumen.
Very solid and compact masses of rock, such as greenstone,
which are not easily affected by other means, are
sometimes corroded by the chemical change of the pyrites
contained in them, by which it is converted into a hydrate
of iron<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>. In certain other rocks, which are also
readily broken down by mechanical agents, clay-slate for
instance, the disintegration is much accelerated by the
decomposition of the pyrites. The oxydulous iron of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473"></a>[473]</span>
felspar is commonly converted by decomposition into a
hydrate or ochre. The carbonate of iron, as well as of
manganese, which sometimes occur in rocks, in limestone
rock for example, are deprived of carbonic acid by the
oxidation of their bases. Charcoal and bitumen, which
are sometimes contained in rocks, limestone and argillaceous
ones for example, are dissipated by the contact
of air, so that rocks which were originally of a dark
colour, lose it, and become whitish. Water, as a chemical
agent, contributes so much to the decomposition of
certain rocks, that, either in a pure state, or in combination
with carbonic acid, it dissolves their parts, of which
gypsum and limestone afford examples. In certain other
minerals, in felspar for instance, a separation of the constituent
parts, produced by the contact of air and water, is
observed, the proximate cause of which has not hitherto
been discovered. The mass is decomposed, its lamellar
structure is converted into an earthy nature, the alkali
contained in the felspar is extracted by the water, a mineral
is produced, to which the Chinese have given the name
of <em>Kaolin</em>, and which is adapted for the manufacture of
porcelain. Granite and gneiss occur in some districts,
the felspar of which is decomposed in this manner
through the whole mass,&mdash;a circumstance which must be
of great importance in regard to the formation of productive
soil.</p>

<p>Cryptogamic plants covering the surface of rocks, and
thriving well in this situation, where more perfect vegetables
could not grow, seem also destined to promote the
chemical decomposition of rocks, an effect which they
produce both directly and indirectly. As they imbibe
the water of the atmosphere, and retain it like a sponge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474"></a>[474]</span>
they keep up a constant application of this substance to
the rock, and in this manner contribute indirectly to its
decomposition. There are some cryptogamic plants also,
which consume certain portions of the rocks with which
they are in contact, corrode their surface, and destroy
the cohesion of its parts, effects which may chiefly be
seen in certain cryptogamic plants attached to calcareous
rocks. In this manner one sort of vegetation prepares a
place for another, and the most imperfect vegetables are
subservient to the growth of the more perfect.</p>

<p>After premising thus much, we shall now proceed to
the examination of the principal rocks, in so far as regards
their connection with the formation of productive
soil, beginning with those which resist decomposition in
the highest degree, and ending with those which are
the most conducive to the formation of loose earth and
soil.</p>

<p>In the first class, we place those rocks which experience
no chemical decomposition, in so far as regards their principal
mass, and whose cohesion of parts is so great that
mechanical powers can only open their natural fissures
to a greater extent, and thus break them down into fragments.
Of this kind are <em>vitreous lava</em>, <em>pure quartz</em>, <em>compact
quartz</em>, <em>flinty slate</em>, and <em>porphyry with a siliceous
basis</em>. On mountains consisting of these rocks, scarcely
any productive soil is found, and frequently none at all.
They are usually characterized by sterile rocks and cliffs,
the bases of which are covered with innumerable rough
fragments of stones, retaining their sharp edges for a
great length of time, the heaps of which seldom produce
any thing else than mosses, which frequently cover the
interstices of fragments, occasionally a few grasses, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475"></a>[475]</span>
sometimes a solitary shrub or tree. Examples, Bennevis,
Paps of Jura, and Morven Hills. Of all rocks, vitreous
volcanic productions are the least capable of contributing
to the formation of productive soil. Their dark coloured
tracts descend from volcanic mountains to the valleys in
frightful sterility, the chinks of their rugged masses
scarcely affording sufficient water for the roots of mosses<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>.
To the second class we refer <em>compact limestone</em>, a rock
which contributes extensively to the formation of the
<ins class="corr" id="tn-475" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'sol d crust'">
solid crust</ins> of the globe. In so far as regards its principal
constituent parts, it is not affected by atmospheric
water or air; but, as its parts have but comparatively
little cohesion, and are usually separated in a considerable
degree by minute fissures, they are more liable to
be broken down and crumbled by mechanical powers,
than those of the rocks belonging to the first class. In
districts where the fundamental rock is limestone, the
layers of loose original soil or subsoil are thin, and filled
with numerous fragments. As the soil arising from the
disintegration of limestone contains a great proportion of
calcareous matter, it is neither favourable to the growth
of plants in general, nor to that of the greater number of
vegetables which are the object of cultivation. Soil of
this kind is too hot, dry and stony; hence the reason
why districts, in which pure limestone rocks predominate,
are often sterile. The case is different, however, where
a portion of clay enters as an ingredient into the composition
of calcareous rocks, for here the soil is usually very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476"></a>[476]</span>
productive; or, where rocks of a different nature alternate
with masses of pure limestone, having a greater
capability than <ins class="corr" id="tn-476" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'it of contributiug'">
it of contributing</ins> to the formation of productive
soil. When water, containing carbonic acid,
passes through limestone rocks, it dissolves portions of
it, and deposits them in other places, by which the
decomposition of the limestone and the formation of loose
earth may be in some measure accelerated.</p>

<p>To the third class belong <em>chalk</em> and <em>gypsum</em>; which,
in so far as regards their decomposition by chemical
means, are of a similar nature with compact limestone;
but possessing a much slighter cohesion of parts, are more
liable to be broken down by mechanical means. Water
also dissolves gypsum, and thus assists in its disintegration.
The soil arising from these rocks resembles that
produced by compact limestone, which explains the want
of fertility, observable in certain gypseous tracts of the
North of Germany, and in the chalk districts of France.
The fertility which we see in certain places where chalk
is the fundamental rock, as in the Isle of Wight, Island
of Rugen, &amp;c. is to be attributed as well to argillaceous
and marly strata alternating with the chalk, as to the
greater humidity of the atmosphere, by which the dryness
and heat of the soil are diminished.</p>

<p>In the fourth class we place certain rocks, composed
of different minerals, but compact in appearance, which,
although they resist mechanical disintegration, are yet
subject to chemical action, and are, by means of it, converted
into a loose, compound productive soil. Of this
kind are <em>basalt</em>, and some other rocks very nearly allied
to it.</p>

<p>To the fifth class we refer those rocks which have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477"></a>[477]</span>
a crystalline, granular, or slaty texture. The mutual
adhesion of the heterogeneous parts, of which they consist,
being, in general, inconsiderable, they are easily
broken down by mechanical means, and thus contribute in
a high degree to the formation of productive soil. The
felspar contained in these rocks, on account of the chemical
decomposition which it readily undergoes, has a great
effect not only upon the quantity, but also the fertility
of the soil produced. The quartz, on the contrary, as
well as the mica and hornblende, long resist chemical decomposition;
they are, however, useful in this respect, that
the argillaceous soil arising from the felspar, has its tenacity
diminished; and is consequently rendered better
adapted for vegetation, by being intermixed with them.
<em>Granite</em> and <em>gneiss</em>, of all truly granular crystalline rocks,
afford the deepest and most fertile soil, aptly compounded
of different substances, sufficiently loose in its aggregation,
and capable of retaining the necessary moisture.
Soil arising from the disintegration of granite is unfavourable
to vegetation only, where the rock abounds much
in quartz, and where the superfluous water cannot run
off, and so gives rise to marshes, which produce only vegetables
of inferior quality; of which we have examples
in the granite districts of Aberdeen. In such places as
these, peat is easily generated, which, although of great
use, is yet much less advantageous than wood. <em>Syenite</em>,
which abounds much in hornblende, is inferior to granite,
with respect to the production of fertile soil; and
primitive <em>greenstone</em>, which resists disintegration and decomposition
in the highest degree, occupies the last place
in this class. In the series of slaty crystalline rocks, <em>mica-slate</em>
is next to gneiss: but on account of the small pro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478"></a>[478]</span>portion
of felspar which enters into its composition, it
does not afford so productive a soil.</p>

<p>In the sixth class may be placed the slaty rocks, whether
simple, or intimately compounded, which do not
readily undergo chemical decomposition, but which easily
separate at their natural fissures, and are mechanically
resolved into an earthy mass, forming a paste with water,
circumstances which are observed chiefly in <em>clay-slate</em>,
a rock of much importance in the formation of
productive soil, usually passing into a clayey sort of
earth.</p>

<p>To the seventh class belong the conglomerated rocks,
whose parts indeed undergo very little, if any, chemical
change, but are easily separated by mechanical means,
and are thus converted into a gravelly, sandy, or earthy
mass. Of this kind are <em>greywacke</em>, <em>old red sandstone</em>,
and sandstones of various kinds. Much diversity is exhibited
by these rocks, with regard to the facility with
which they undergo disintegration, as well as the nature
of the soil arising from them; circumstances which
chiefly depend upon the nature of the cement, and its
relation to the parts cemented. The disintegration of
these rocks is the more easily effected that the cement is
abundant, and less intimately connected with the other
parts, that is, the more they depart from a crystalline
nature; on which account greywacke is less easily converted
into soil, than the common varieties of sandstone.
By the decomposition of greywacke, a loose and fertile
soil is formed, containing particles of quartz and clay in
due proportion; on the other hand, by the decomposition
of red sandstone, a soil is frequently produced, abounding
in argillaceous particles impregnated with iron,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479"></a>[479]</span>
and therefore stiff and cold. The <em>variegated sandstone</em>,
with a marly cement, not unfrequently affords a
pretty fertile soil; the <em>quadersandstein</em>, on the contrary,
commonly presents a sandy and arid soil.</p>

<p>Lastly, in the eighth class we shall place those rocks,
whether simple or intimately compounded, whose nature
is so loose, or whose parts are so separated, that they
fall with great facility into an earthy mass, and are also
in part mechanically reduced by water. To this class
belong the different varieties of <em>marl</em>, <em>slate-clay</em>, <em>basaltic</em>
and <em>volcanic tuffa</em>. These rocks, many of which are extensively
diffused, are of much importance in the formation
of productive soil, although the quality of the earth
produced by them varies much, according to their different
natures. Slate-clay affords an argillaceous soil; in
earth produced by the decomposition of marl, the clay is
diminished in proportion to the greater abundance of the
calcareous or sandy parts; while a mixed and very fertile
soil is usually generated from basaltic and volcanic
tufas.</p>

<p>The various relations which exist in the stratification
and position of rocks, have much influence in producing
a diversity in the soil formed immediately from their decomposition.
This diversity cannot be so great when
different rocks of various ages occur in a determinate order
in horizontal strata; in which case, the uppermost
bed may exhibit a great extent of surface of the same
nature. When, on the other hand, strata of rocks of different
natures, forms, and dimensions, placed at different
angles of inclination, and in different directions, appear
at the surface, it will easily be understood how it may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480"></a>[480]</span>
happen that the soil produced by their decomposition
may occur of very different qualities, in places not very
distant from each other. The manner in which the soil
is influenced by a difference in the arrangement and position
of the strata, will become evident, on comparing
districts in which one particular sort of rock lies beneath
the surface in horizontal strata, with others in which the
solid substratum is composed of various rocks differing
in their inclination towards the horizon. In districts of
the former kind, the qualities of the soil vary in general
but little; in such as are of the latter kind, on the
contrary, they are often found extremely different. The
great diversity of soil seen in England, as well as in
Germany, may, in fact, be partly explained by the circumstance,
that, in those countries, the nature and position
of the strata vary every where. On the other
hand, the great similarity which pervades the soil of
Southern Russia, is without doubt produced by a uniformity
in the position and inclination of the limestone
which lies immediately under the soil.</p>

<p>The nature of the principal mass of the strata usually
exerts a great degree of influence over the qualities of
the soil. When the solid substratum is sandstone, its
effect upon the soil is, in general, as evidently seen,
though not perhaps in an equal degree, as when it is
marl. Exceptions, however, to this rule sometimes occur;
as, for instance, when the principal mass of a rock
which resists disintegration in a high degree contains
beds that are easily reduced to earth. This is the case
with the shell-limestone (muschelkalkstein) of Germany,
the mountains of which are not unfrequently co<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481"></a>[481]</span>vered
with a clayey soil, which has not been produced
by the decomposition of the principal strata themselves,
but by that of the slate-clay and argillaceous marl alternating
with them.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have considered untransported soil, or that
produced from the disintegration or decomposition of the
subjacent rocks in the places where it occurs; we have
now to examine the relations which exist between the
subjacent rock, and the <em>transported soil</em> lying upon it.
The nature of the rock does not indeed influence, excepting
in a more remote degree, the transported soil, which
has been carried to a greater or less distance from the
places of its production, by the agency of moving
powers, and again deposited of various forms and
compositions. However, it may often be plainly seen,
that the materials of this soil have been derived from
particular rocks, and that these rocks have exerted some
degree of influence over the formation and distribution
of the transported soil. The examination of these relations
is of great importance, because it is with secondary
or transported soil that agriculture is principally concerned.
The varieties of transported soil depend chiefly
upon three circumstances: <em>1st</em>, The nature of the rocks
from which they are derived; <em>2dly</em>, The quality and effect
of the moving powers; <em>3dly</em>, The changes which they
may have undergone after their formation.</p>

<p>The origin of the materials which enter into the composition
of transported soil, has been already considered.
From their difference may be easily explained why soil
generated from the debris of primitive crystalline rocks
has different qualities from soil which has been derived
from strata of sandstone or marl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482"></a>[482]</span></p>

<p>The principal powers which contribute to the transportation
of soil, are, The weight of loose masses, ice,
and water. The weight of loose masses is a cause of
transportation which we frequently see in operation. By
it the huge cones of debris at the base and upon the declivities
of precipices and mountains, are gradually carried
off toward the bottom of the valleys; a phenomenon
which can scarcely any where be better seen than in the
valleys of the Alps, where mountains sometimes occur
evidently consisting of debris, and clothed with trees and
shrubs, or covered with pastures, the masses of which
are gradually moved, as upon inclined planes, by the action
of the water which percolates through them.</p>

<p>Ice effects the transportation of rocks and debris, with
a power which nothing can resist. This is no where
more conspicuous than among the glaciers of the Alps,
by the falling of which great heaps of stones and rubbish
are produced. The transportation of large stones by
means of ice may also be seen in our mountain torrents
in winter. Huge masses of stone, scattered over the
plains of the north of Germany and the islands of Denmark,
and often very prejudicial to agriculture, whose
northern origin appears to be established, may have been
carried by the same powerful agent from Finland, Sweden
and Norway, into those countries, at a time when
the plains of northern Germany, with the other flat districts
along the shores of the Baltic, were still covered
by the waves of the ocean.</p>

<p>In the formation of transported soil, water usually
exerts a great degree of power. By means of it, not
only are vast masses transported to the greatest distances,
but their parts are at the same time crumbled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483"></a>[483]</span>
down and mingled together. To these operations are
to be attributed the various terminations of different
soils at horizontal distances, as well as the different alternations
of their strata at vertical ones. The power of
water in the formation of transported soil varies, not
only according to the different inclinations of its channel,
but also in regard to the form, size, and weight of the
parts carried off by it; for which reason, in the formation
of such soils, the same phenomena take place on a
large scale, that we see on a smaller, in performing the
operations of breaking and washing the ores of metals.
For the same reason that, in these processes, the larger
particles subside, while the smaller are propelled, from
which again the heavier particles of ore are sooner deposited
than the lighter; in plains in the vicinity of a
mountain, covered with transported soil, stones and debris
are usually seen first, then earth, clay, and sand mixed
together, and farther on, finer sand, with strata of clay.</p>

<p>Transported or secondary soil, produced by water,
according to the mode of its formation, is divided into
four classes, viz.&mdash;1. Soil of Valleys; 2. River Soil;
3. Lake Soil; 4. Marine Soil.</p>

<p>1. <em>Soil of Valleys.</em>&mdash;It is washed down by rain and snow
water, and partly also produced by rivulets, which carry
off the loose parts from the declivities of mountains to
the plains. The nature of this soil in general clearly
shews the nearness of its origin. Its depth is always
greatest in the bottom of the valley, and gradually diminishes
toward the declivities of the mountains. The
curvature of the different strata is usually accommodated
to the irregularity of its external form, so that when a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484"></a>[484]</span>
section is made of them, they exhibit a series of parallel
curved lines.</p>

<p>2. <em>River Soil</em>, or the soil found in the beds and banks
of rivers, and which is produced by the continual propelling
power of large rivers. To this class belong two
different kinds; <em>1st</em>, Soil containing pebbles of various
sizes, produced by the power of torrents in the vicinity
of mountains; and, <em>2d</em>, Earth or mud, deposited in the
beds of rivers, in places at a distance from mountains.
A peculiarity of river soil in general is, that it is much
extended in length, while its breadth is comparatively
but small. The different layers have neither so much
irregularity as in the preceding kind, nor are they so
precise in arrangement as in the following.</p>

<p>3. <em>Lake Soil</em>, deposited at the bottom of still water.
To this class is to be referred the soil in the bottoms of
valleys, which had formerly been lakes, either separate
or connected with rivers. The horizontal dimensions of
this kind of soil are often more or less equal. Sometimes,
indeed, the length is greater than the breadth; not,
however, in the same degree as in soil deposited in the
bed of rivers. The surface is usually plane, and the different
strata alternate in a parallel manner.</p>

<p>4. <em>Marine Soil</em>, that is to say, the mud of the ancient
ocean. It is the greatest of all in its extent, both
in a horizontal and a vertical direction. Its surface is
more or less undulated, very seldom even. Its masses
are both very thick and very uniform in composition.
Different and alternating strata, however, do occur,
whose forms and dimensions are usually more or less
regular, and which are not unfrequently undulated.</p>

<p>Soil, after being formed, is acted upon by natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485"></a>[485]</span>
powers in various ways. The atmosphere is perpetually
modifying it; rivers, waves, and winds, act here and
there upon its surface, and alter its external form; water
introduces into it the substances which it holds in solution.
The different constituent parts of soil act upon
each other chemically, and in this manner new decompositions
and mixtures are produced; and this chemical
change is increased by the action of vegetables, as well
as of bodies deriving their origin from both organic
kingdoms.</p>

<p>From what has been said of the relations existing between
the masses of which the solid crust of the globe is
composed, and the loose earth or soil by which it is covered,
it appears evident enough (Hausmann concludes)
that they have great influence over its formation and nature,
and therefore upon the more perfect vegetables,
and especially those which are the objects of cultivation;
and that although the fertility of the soil is much
increased by these vegetables themselves, yet the first
foundation of their vigour is derived from the disintegration
and decomposition of rocks. If this be correct,
the constitution of the solid crust of the earth has a
much more extended influence. For, by preparing a
habitation for the greater and most important parts of
plants, it also exerts a high degree of influence upon the
animals which derive their sustenance from them, and, at
the same time, affords the means of subsistence to man<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>.</p>

<h3 class="fs70">ACCOUNT OF THE IRISH ELK, FOSSIL ELEPHANT OR MAMMOTH,
AND THE MASTODON.</h3>

<p>As the Irish Elk, the Fossil Elephant or Mammoth,
and the Mastodon, are among the most remarkable of the
fossil and extinct species of quadrupeds mentioned in the
preceding pages of this work, we, with the view of farther
gratifying the curiosity of our readers, now lay before
them the following additional details from the writings
of Cuvier, Goldfuss, and others.</p>


<h4>1. <em>Fossil Elk of Ireland</em>, Cervus megaceros<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>.</h4>

<p class="pfs80">(<em>Noticed at</em> p. 286.)</p>

<p>One of the most magnificent of the bisulcated animals
met with in a fossil state in the British Islands is the
Elk of Ireland, the <em>Cervus megaceros</em>. Bones and
horns of vast size of this species are almost daily dug out
of the bogs and marl pits of Ireland. Similar remains
have been met with in alluvial strata in Britain,
and also in the Isle of Man.</p>

<p>“So frequently do these remains,” Mr Hart remarks,
“occur in most parts of Ireland, that there are very few
of the peasantry who are not, either from personal observation
or report, acquainted with them by the familiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487"></a>[487]</span>
name of the horns of the ‘old deer.’ Indeed in some
parts of the country they have been found so often, that
far from being regarded as objects of any extraordinary
interest, they have been either thrown aside as lumber,
or applied to the commonest economical uses<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>.</p>

<p>“I have made diligent but fruitless search for an account
of the particular time when any of these remains
were first discovered. As they generally occur in marl,
it is most likely that they did not begin to attract attention
until the advanced state of agriculture had created
an increased demand for that mineral as a manure. We
can very easily imagine the astonishment which the appearance
of horns so large, and of such strange form,
must have excited in the minds of those who discovered
them for the first time, and how readily they obtained a
place in the hall of some adjoining mansion, where they
were deposited as an ornament of great curiosity, from
the contrast which they formed with the horns of the
species of deer known at present. In this way we may
account for the preservation of so many specimens as are
found in the possession of the gentry in different parts
of this country.</p>

<p>“Very lately an entire skeleton of the Irish Elk was
dug up in that country. The following statement of the circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488"></a>[488]</span>
under which the bones were found, with their
geological position, was laid before the Dublin Society,
in a letter from Archdean Maunsell to the Right Hon.
George Knox.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<em>Middleton Lodge, March 8. 1825.</em></p>

<p class="fs70 pad2">“MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>“I deferred replying to your letter of the 1st, as it
was my intention to proceed to Limerick in a few days,
and I was anxious to look over some notes I had taken,
and which I left there, of the circumstances connected
with the discovery of the fossil remains which the Royal
Dublin Society have received. As I have, however,
been obliged to postpone my departure for several days,
I can no longer defer offering my best thanks for the
kind manner in which you have received the conjectures
which I formed upon a subject to which my attention was
directed, by having fortunately been present before the
bones were disturbed from the situation in which they
had lain during a period which I apprehend it would
not be easy to define. I am sensible that any consideration
which may have been attached to my observations
should be attributed to the interest which the subject
itself is calculated to excite, rather than to any ability
of mine to do it justice. The opinion which I took the
liberty of communicating to you was formed after some
consideration, and although I had not the most remote
idea of its being worthy of any attention, I can have no
objection to your making any use of it which you may
conceive expedient. There is, I conceive, much interesting
material for speculation, resulting from the discovery
of these fossil remains, and the first that naturally
occurs is the manner in which the animals were de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489"></a>[489]</span>stroyed,
and the bones so singularly preserved. I stated,
in the hasty sketch which I gave you of my theory
upon this point, that I apprehended they must have
been destroyed by some overwhelming deluge, that they
were probably drowned upon the hills where they had
taken refuge, as the waters rose, and that, as they subsided,
they were drawn from thence into the valley in
which they were found; that the agitation of the waters
had occasioned such a dispersion of the bones, when
the ligaments dissolved, as would account for their having
been scattered in the way in which they were
found, and that the deposite of shell marl, with which I
supposed the water to have been turbid, had so completely
protected them from atmospheric influence as to
prevent their subsequent decomposition. To enable
you to form some estimate of the reasonableness of this
supposition, it is necessary that I should endeavour to
explain the situation, &amp;c. of the valley and the adjoining
hills. The valley in which the remains were found contains
about twenty plantation acres, and the soil consists
of a stratum of peat about a foot thick, immediately
under this a stratum of shell-marl, varying from 1½ to
2½ feet in thickness; in this many of the shells retain
their original colour and figure, and are not marine;
under the marl there is a bed of light blue clay; through
this one of my workmen drove an iron rod, in several
places, twelve feet deep, without meeting opposition.
Most of the bones and heads, eight in number, were
found in the marl; many of them, however, appeared
to rest on the clay, and to be merely covered by the
marl. The remains were disposed in such a manner
as to prevent the possibility of ascertaining the exact
component parts of each skeleton; in some places por<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490"></a>[490]</span>tions
were found removed many yards from others, and
in no instance were two bones found lying close to each
other. Their position also was singular; in one place
two heads were found, with the antlers entwined in each
other, and immediately under them a large blade-bone;
in another, a very large head was discovered, and although
a most diligent search was made, no part of the
skeleton found; within some hundred yards, in another,
the jaw-bones were found, and not the head. The
conclusion which, I conceive, may fairly be deduced
from such a position of the various parts of the animals
is, that there must have been some powerful agent employed
in dispersing them after their death; and as I
consider it impossible that their own gravity could have
been sufficient to sink them through the various strata,
I conceive these must have originated subsequently to
the dispersion of the bones. I also think, that, if they
had been exposed for any time to atmospheric influence,
they never could have been preserved in their present
extraordinary perfection.</p>

<p>“The hills immediately adjoining this valley are
composed of limestone, with a covering of rich mould
of various degrees of thickness. One of them, whose
base is about thirty acres, rises directly from the edge
of the valley, with sides very precipitous, and in one
place perfectly perpendicular, of naked limestone. In
every part of this hill the superficies comprises as much
stone as mould; on the side nearly opposite, the hill is
equally high, but the sides not so steep, and the covering
of mould thicker; on the other sides the ground only
rises in some degree (twenty or thirty feet perhaps),
and consists of a thin mould, and immediately under a
<em>very hard</em> limestone gravel. Indeed, except where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491"></a>[491]</span>
limestone forms the substratum, this is the character of
all the soil in the vicinity except the Corkasses, which
are evidently alluvial. I am fully aware, that, assuming
the destruction of the animals to have been occasioned
by a flood, they would naturally have retreated from
the water to the hills, and that, as they probably met
their fate there, their remains should have been discovered
on the summit of the hills, and not in the valley,
particularly as one of them is perfectly flat on the top,
which contains six or seven acres. I apprehend that
the remains of many of them were deposited on the
tops of the hills; but as they have <em>now</em> only a slight
covering of mould, not sufficient to cover a small dog,
they were formerly perfectly bare; and as they were
thus devoid of the means of protecting the remains
from the atmosphere, whatever was left there soon became
decomposed, and resolved into portions of the
mould, which is now to be found on the hills. This remark
I conceive also to be applicable to the soil with
the substratum of limestone gravel, which affords quite
as little material for preserving the bones as the hills
do.</p>

<p>“It is material that I should observe, that of eight
heads which we found, none were without antlers; the
variety in character also was such as to induce me to
imagine, that possibly the females were not devoid of
these appendages. Unfortunately, however, from the
difficulty of raising them, being saturated with water,
and as soft as wet brown paper, only three were at all
perfect.</p>

<p>“Having now disposed of these antediluvians, a question
naturally arises, how it happens that the fossil remains
of no other animals were found, when the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492"></a>[492]</span>
fate probably overwhelmed every existing creature?
Could deer have been the only living beings at that
period? Was Ireland part of a great continent when
this catastrophe occurred, and were these unfortunates
the first emigrants to our Isle from that great centre
from whence the globe was supplied with occupants,
and did they perish before other animals less influenced
by enterprise, and less endowed with physical strength,
could have followed their example? These problems
I confess myself unable to solve, and shall not presume
to obtrude my many reveries upon this and other points,
which have originated in the discovery of a few bones,
upon those who I know are so much better competent
to form a sound opinion. I shall, I hope, be able to
send the antlers, which are very fine, on the 15th of this
month.</p>

<p>“If you have a desire to make any use of this letter,
I can only say I have no objection. I remain, dear Sir,
with feelings of great respect,</p>

<p class="center">“Yours most truly,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">William W. Maunsell</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Of this skeleton, the most perfect hitherto found, the
following interesting description is given by Mr Hart,
in his memoir.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This magnificent skeleton is perfect in every single
bone of the framework which contributes to form a part
of its general outline: the spine, the chest, the pelvis,
and the extremities, are all complete in this respect; and,
when surmounted by the head, and beautifully expanded
antlers, which extend out to a distance of nearly six
feet on either side, forms a splendid display of the re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493"></a>[493]</span>liques
of the former grandeur of the animal kingdom,
and carries back the imagination to a period when whole
herds of this noble animal wandered at large over the
face of the country.</p>

<p>To proceed with a description of the several parts
of this specimen in detail, I shall commence with the
horns, which give the animal its chief characteristic feature.</p>

<p><em>The horns.</em>&mdash;That the description of these may be the
more intelligible, I will first explain the terms which I
mean to apply to their several parts. Each horn consists
of the socket or root, the burr or coronary circle,
the beam or shaft, the palm and the antlers.</p>

<p>The socket or root is the part of the horn which
grows out of the frontal bone, and which is never shed;
it is smooth, of a brown colour, an inch and half in
length, and eleven inches three quarters in circumference;
in the animal’s lifetime it was covered by the
skin. The coronary or bead-like circle, or burr, is a
ring of small, hard, whitish prominences, resembling a
string of pearls, which encircles the junction of the socket
with the part of the horn which falls annually from
the heads of all deer.</p>

<p>The beam or shaft extends outwards, with a curvature
whose concavity looks downwards, and backwards.
This part is nearly cylindrical at its root, and its length
equals about one-fourth of that of the whole horn; its
outer end is spread out and flattened on its upper surface,
and is continuous <ins class="corr" id="tn-493" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'with the\nPalm'">
with the palm</ins>, which expands outwards in a fan-like form, the
outer extremity of which measures two feet ten inches
across, being its broadest part. Where the beam joins<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494"></a>[494]</span>
the palm the horn undergoes a kind of twist, the effect
of which on the palm is, to place its edges above and below,
and its surfaces anterior and posterior; the anterior
surface is convex, and looks outwards; the posterior is
concave, and its surface looks towards that of the opposite
palm. Such is the position of the horns, when the
head is so placed that the zygomatic arch is parallel to
the horizon, as it would be during progression, or whilst
the animal stands in an easy posture.</p>

<p>The antlers are the long pointed processes which project
from the horns, two of which grow from the beam
anteriorly; the first comes off immediately from the root,
and is directed downwards, overhanging the orbit; this
is called the brow antler, which, in this specimen, is divided
into two points at its extremity<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>.</p>

<p>The other antler, which comes off from the beam, we
may call the sur-antler: in this specimen it consists of a
broad plate or palm, concave on its upper surface, horizontal
in its direction, and forked into two points anteriorly,&mdash;an
appearance which I have not observed in any
other specimen of upwards of forty which I have seen,
nor do I find it marked in any of the plates of those
bones extant.</p>

<p>There is one antler given off posteriorly from the junction
of the beam with the palm: it runs directly backwards
parallel to the corresponding one of the opposite
horn. The inferior edge of the palm beyond this runs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495"></a>[495]</span>
outwards and backwards: it is obtuse and thick, and its
length is two feet six inches. From the anterior and external
borders of each palm there come off six long pointed
antlers. None of these are designated by any particular
name. The number of the antlers of both sides
taken together is twenty-two.</p>

<p>The surface of the horns is of a lightish colour, resembling
that of the marl in which they were found;
they are rough, and marked with several arborescent
grooves, where the ramifications of the arteries by which
they had been nourished during their growing state were
lodged. The horns, with the head attached, weighed
eighty-seven pounds avoirdupois. The distance between
their extreme tips in a right line is nine feet two
inches.</p>

<p><em>Head.</em>&mdash;The forehead is marked by a raised ridge
extended between the roots of the horns; anterior to
this, between the orbits and the root of the nose, the
skull is flat; there is a depression on each side in front
of the root of the horn and over the orbit, capable of
lodging the last joint of the thumb, at the bottom of
which is the superciliary hole, large enough to give passage
to an artery proportioned to the size of the horns.
Inferior to the orbit we have the lachrymatory fossa,
and the opening left by the deficiency of bone common
to all deer, and remarkable for being smaller in this than
in any other species.</p>

<p>Below the orbits the skull grows suddenly narrower,
and the upper parts of the nasal bones become contracted
by a depression on either side, at the lower part of
which is the infra-orbitar hole. The opening of the
nares is oval, being five inches long by three broad, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496"></a>[496]</span>
greatest breadth being in the centre. From the roots
of the horns to the occipital spine measures three inches
and an half; the occiput descends at a right angle with
this, being three inches deep to the foramen magnum:
the greatest breadth of the occiput is eight inches. The
temporal fossæ approach to within two inches of each
other behind the horns.</p>

<p><em>Teeth.</em>&mdash;They do not differ from those of animals of
the ruminating class. The incisors were not found, having
dropped out; there is no mark of canine teeth; the
molares are not much worn down, and are twenty-four
in number.</p>

<p>The skeleton measures, from the end of the nose to
the tip of the tail, ten feet ten inches. The spine consists
of twenty-six vertebræ, viz. seven cervical, thirteen
dorsal, and six lumbar. The size of the cervical vertebræ
greatly exceeds that of the other classes, and the
spines of the dorsal rise to a foot in height. The necessity
of these bones being so marked is obvious, considering
the strong cervical ligament, and powerful muscles,
required for supporting and moving a head which,
at a moderate calculation, must have sustained a weight
of three quarters of a hundred of solid bony matter.</p>

<p>The extremities are in proportion to the different parts
of the trunk, and present a conformation favourable to a
combination of great strength with fleetness.</p>

<p>It is not the least remarkable circumstance connected
with these bones, that they are in such a high state of
preservation as to present all the lines and impressions
of the parts which had been attached to them in the recent
state. Indeed, if we examine them as compared
with the bones of an animal from which all the softer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497"></a>[497]</span>
parts have been separated by maceration, the only perceptible
differences in their physical properties are, that
they are a little heavier, a degree harder, that their surface
is brown, and that they all, with the exception of
the horns, present a polished appearance, which is owing
to the periosteum having been preserved, and still remaining
to cover them, as was discovered when they were
chemically examined.</p>

<p>The existence of fat or adipocire in the shaft of one
of the bones mentioned by Archdeacon Maunsell, and
which I saw in his possession, is a thing for which it is
extremely difficult to account, as it occurred but in one
solitary instance, and it did not appear that this bone
was at all differently circumstanced from the rest. Those
which I had an opportunity of examining, by boring
holes in them, were hollow, and contained, for the most
part, only a small quantity of black animal earth.</p>

<p>Dr Apjohn of Dublin made the following observations
with regard to the animal matter in the bones:</p>

<p>‘The bone was subjected for two days to the action
of dilute muriatic acid. When examined at the end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498"></a>[498]</span>
of this period, it had become as flexible as a recent bone
submitted to the action of the same solvent. The periosteum
was in some parts puffed out by carbonic acid
gas, disengaged from the bone, and appeared to be in a
state of perfect soundness.</p>

<p>‘To a portion of the solution of the bone in the muriatic
acid some infusion of galls was added, which caused
a copious precipitate of a dun colour. This proved
to be tannate of gelatine, mixed with a small portion of
the tannate and gallate of iron.</p>

<p>‘The cartilage and gelatine, therefore, so far from
being destroyed, had not been perceptibly altered by
time.’”</p></div>

<p>Until Baron Cuvier published his account of these
remains<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>, they were generally believed to have belonged
to the same species as the moose deer or elk of North
America, an opinion which appears to have been first
advanced by Dr Thomas Molyneux in 1697<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>, and
which depends principally on the exaggerated description
of that animal given by Josselyn in his account of
two voyages to New England, published in 1674, in
which he states that it is sometimes twelve feet high,
with horns of two fathoms wide! This was the more
readily believed by the learned Doctor, as it tended to
confirm him in a favourite theory which he seems to
have entertained, that Ireland had once been joined to
the New Continent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499"></a>[499]</span></p>

<p>But the assertions of Josselyn regarding the size of
the American moose have not been confirmed by the
testimony of later travellers, from whose observations it
is now clearly ascertained that the only large species of
deer inhabiting the northern parts of America are the
wapiti or Canadian stag (<em>Cervus canadensis</em>), the rein-deer
(<em>C. Tarandus</em>), and the moose or elk (<em>C. Alces</em>).</p>

<p>The peculiar branching of the brow antlers of the
rein-deer, and the rounded horns of the wapiti<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>, are
characters sufficient to prevent us confounding either of
these animals with the fossil species.</p>

<p>The palmate form of the horns of the elk gave greater
probability to the opinion of its specific identity with the
fossil animal.</p>

<p>A little attention, however, to a few circumstances,
will shew a most marked difference between them.</p>

<p>First, as to size, the difference is very remarkable, it
not being uncommon to find the fossil horns ten feet
between the extreme tips<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>, while the largest elk’s horns
never measure four feet. This measurement in a pair
in the Museum of the Royal Dublin Society, is three
feet seven inches: the largest pair seen by Pennant in
the house of the Hudson’s Bay Company, measured
thirty-four inches<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>.</p>

<p>The horn of the elk has two palms, a lesser one which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500"></a>[500]</span>
grows forward from the front of the beam, where the
principal palm begins to expand. This is called brow
antler by Cuvier, but it corresponds in situation rather
to the sur-antler, there being, properly speaking, no
brow antler attached to the root of the beam. The elk
has no posterior antler similar to that of the fossil animal,
nor does its beam take a similar arched direction,
but runs more directly outwards.</p>

<p>Cuvier remarks, that the palm of the fossil horn increases
in breadth as it extends outwardly, while that
of the elk is broadest next the beam.</p>

<p>The palm of the elk’s horn is directed more backwards,
while the fossil one extends more in the lateral
direction. The antlers of the elk are shorter and more
numerous than those of the fossil animals.</p>

<p>As the horns of the fossil animal exceed in size those
of the elk, so, on the contrary, does the skull of the latter
exceed in size that of the former; the largest heads of
the fossil species not exceeding one foot nine inches in
length, while the head of the elk is frequently two feet.
The fossil head is broader in proportion; its length
being to its breadth as two to one; in the elk they are
as three to one, according to Parkinson.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> The breadth
of the skull between the roots of the horns is but four
inches in the fossil skulls; in that of the elk in the Society’s
Museum it is 6½ inches.</p>

<p>Cuvier thinks it probable that the females of the fossil
species had horns<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>, an opinion to which I am very much
disposed to subscribe, from having observed that these
parts present differences in size and strength, which ap<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501"></a>[501]</span>pear
not to be dependent on differences of age. For instance,
the teeth of the specimen in Trinity College are
much more worn down, and the sutures of the skull are
more effaced than in the specimen described in this
paper; yet the horns of the latter are much more concave,
and more expanded, than those of the former; and
on comparing a single horn of each of these specimens
together, that belonging to the Society exceeds the other
by nearly a sixth in the length, and little less than a
third in the breadth; it is not, therefore, unlikely that the
animal whose horns were larger and more curved was a
male. Something similar to this is observed in the
rein-deer, both sexes of which have horns, but with this
difference, that they are smaller and less branched in
the female. Hence we find that this animal possessed
characters of its own sufficient to prove it of a species
as distinct from the moose or elk as this latter species is
from the rein-deer or any other. Therefore, it is improper
to retain the name of elk or moose deer any longer:
perhaps it might be better called the <em>Cervus megaceros</em>,
a name merely expressive of the great size of its
horns.</p>

<p>That this animal shed its head furniture periodically,
is proved by the occasional occurrence of detached horns
having the smooth convex surface below the burr, similar
to what is observed on the cast horns of all deer.
Specimens of this are to be seen in the Museum of Trinity
College, and I possess one myself, of which I have
had a drawing made. As every other species of deer
shed their horns annually, there is no reason for supposing
that that process occurred at longer intervals in
this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502"></a>[502]</span></p>

<p>It is a popular opinion with the Indians that the elk
is subject to epilepsy, with which he is frequently seized
when pursued, and thus rendered an easy prey to the
hunters. Many naturalists affect to disbelieve this account,
without, however, assigning any sufficient reason.
But if it be considered, that, during the growth
of the horns, there must be a great increased determination
of blood to those parts, which are supplied by the
frontal artery, a branch from the internal carotid, it is
quite conformable to well established pathological principles,
to suppose, that, after the horns are perfected, and
have ceased to receive any more blood, that fluid may
be determined to those internal branches of the carotid
which supply the brain, and establish a predisposition
to such derangements of its circulation as would produce
epilepsy, or even apoplexy: if such an effect were produced
in consequence of the size of the horns in the
elk, it is reasonable to suppose that it prevailed in a
greater degree in the fossil animal whose horns were so
much larger.</p>

<p>What could have been the use of these immense
horns? It is quite evident that they would prevent the
animal making any progress through a thickly wooded
country, and that the long, tapering, pointed antlers
were totally unfit for lopping off the branches of trees,
a use to which the elk sometimes applies his horns<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>, and
for which they seem well calculated, by having their
antlers short and strong, and set along the edge of the
palm, somewhat resembling the teeth of a saw in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503"></a>[503]</span>
arrangement. It would rather appear, then, that they
were given the animal as weapons for its protection, a
purpose for which they seem to have been admirably designed;
for their lateral expansion is such, that should
occasion require the animal to use them in his defence,
their extreme tips would easily reach beyond the remotest
parts of his body; and if we consider the powerful
muscles for moving the head, whose attachments occupied
the extensive surfaces of the cervical vertebræ,
with the length of the lever afforded by the horns themselves,
we can easily conceive how he could wield them
with a force and velocity which would deal destruction
to any enemy having the hardihood to venture within
their range.</p>

<p>From the formidable appearance of these horns, then,
we must suppose that their possessor was obnoxious to
the aggressions of some carnivorous animals of ferocious
habits; and such we know to have abounded in
Ireland, as the wolf, and the celebrated Irish wolf
dog. Nor would it be surprising if limestone caves
should be discovered in this country, containing the
remains of beasts of prey and their victims, similar to
the hyænas’ dens of Kirkdale, and other places, respecting
which such interesting researches have been lately
laid before the public by the geologists of this country and
the Continent.</p>

<p>The absence of all record, or even tradition, respecting
this animal<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>, naturally leads one to inquire whe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504"></a>[504]</span>ther
man inhabited this country during its existence?
I think there is presumptive evidence in the affirmative
of this question, afforded by the following circumstances.
A head of this animal described by Professor Goldfuss
of Bonn, was discovered in Germany in the same drain
with several urns and stone hatchets; and in the 7th
volume of the Archæologia Britannica, is a letter of
the Countess of Moira, giving an account of a human
body found in gravel, under eleven feet of peat soaked
in the bog water: it was in good preservation, and
completely clothed in antique garments of hair, which
her ladyship thinks might have been that of our fossil
animal. But more conclusive evidence on this question
is derived from the appearance exhibited by a rib,
presented by Archdeacon Maunsell to the Royal Dublin
Society, in which I discovered an oval opening
near its lower edge, the long diameter of which is
parallel to the length of the rib, its margin is depressed
on the outer, and raised on the inner surface, round
which there is an irregular effusion of callus. This
opening had been evidently produced by a sharp pointed
instrument, which did not penetrate so deep as to cause
the animal’s death, but which remained fixed in the
opening for some length of time afterward; in fact
it was such an effect as would be produced by the head of
an arrow remaining in a wound after the shaft was broken
off<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505"></a>[505]</span></p>

<p>It is not improbable, therefore, that the chace of this
gigantic animal once supplied the inhabitants of this country
with food and clothing.</p>

<p>As to the causes which led to the extinction of this
animal, whether it was suddenly destroyed by the deluge,
or by some other great catastrophe of nature, or
whether it was ultimately exterminated by the continued
and successful persecution of its pursuers, as
has nearly been the case with the red deer within the
recollection of many of the present generation, I profess
myself unable to form any decided opinion, owing
to the limited number of facts as yet collected on the
subject. On some future occasion I may, perhaps, be
induced to revert to so interesting a topic, should I have
opportunities of discovering any thing worthy of communication.</p>

<h4 class="p2">2. <em>Account of the Two Living Species of Elephant,
and of the Extinct Species of Elephant, or Mammoth.</em></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Elephas africanus.</span>&mdash;<em>The Elephant with rounded
skull, large ears, grinders, having rhomboidal-shaped
marks on their crown, which we call the African Elephant</em>
(<em>Elephas Africanus</em>), is a quadruped which has
hitherto been found only inhabiting Africa. There can
be no doubt that it is this species which lives at the
Cape, at Senegal, and in Guinea; there is reason to believe
that it also occurs at Mosambique; but it is not
certain that individuals of the following species do not
occur in this part of Africa. A sufficient number of
individuals have not been figured or compared, to know
if this species presents remarkable varieties. It is it that
produces the largest tusks. Both sexes are equally furnished
with tusks, at least at Senegal. <em>The natural number
of the hoofs is four before, and three behind.</em> The
ear is very large, and covers the shoulder. The skin is
of a deep and uniform brown. This species has not
been domesticated in modern times. It appears, however,
to have been tamed by the ancients, who attributed
to it less power and courage in that state than to the following
species; but their observations do not appear to
have been confirmed, at least in so far as refers to magnitude.
Its natural manners are not perfectly known;
yet judging of them by the notices of travellers, they
appear to resemble in every thing essential those of the
following species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_509"></a>[509]</span></p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Elephas indicus.</span>&mdash;<em>The Elephant with elongated
skull, concave forehead, small ears, grinders marked
with undulating bands</em>, which we call the <em>Indian Elephant</em>
(<em>Elephas Indicus</em>), is a quadruped which has only
been observed with certainty beyond the Indus. It extends
from both sides of the Ganges to the Eastern Sea
and the south of China. They are also found in the
Islands of the Indian Sea, in Ceylon, Java, Borneo, Sumatra,
&amp;c. There is still no authentic proof that it
exists in any part of Africa, although neither is the contrary
absolutely proved. The inhabitants of India
having from time immemorial been in the habit of taking
this species and taming it, it has been much better observed
than the other. Varieties have been remarked as
to size, lightness of form, the length and direction of the
tusks, and the colours of the skin. The females and
some of the males have tusks which are always small and
straight. The tusks of the other males never attain so
great a length as in the African species<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>. <em>The natural
number of the hoofs is five before and four behind.</em> The
ear is small, frequently angular. The skin is commonly
grey, spotted with brown. There are individuals entirely
white. The height varies from fifteen to sixteen feet.
Its manners, the mode of taking it, and of treating it,
have been carefully described by many travellers and naturalists,
from Aristotle down to Mr Corse Scott.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510"></a>[510]</span></p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Elephas primigenius</span>, Blum, or <span class="smcap">Mammoth</span>.&mdash;<em>The
Elephant with elongated skull, concave forehead,
very long alveolæ for the tusks, the lower jaw obtuse,
the grinders broader, parallel, marked with closer bands</em>,
which we name the <em>Fossil Elephant</em> (<em>Elephas primigenius</em>,
Blum.), is the <em>Mammoth</em> of the Russians. Its
bones are only found in the fossil state. No person has
seen in a fresh state bones resembling those by which
this species is peculiarly distinguished, nor have the
bones of the two preceding species been seen in the fossil
state.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Its bones are found in great number in many
countries, but in better preservation in the north than
elsewhere. It resembles the Indian more than the African
species. It differs, however, from the former in the
grinders, in the form of the lower jaw, and many other
bones, but especially in the length of the alveolæ and
tusks. This last character must have singularly modified
the figure and organisation of its proboscis, and
given it a physiognomy much more different from that
of the Indian species, than might have been expected
from the similarity of the rest of their bones. It appears
that its tusks were generally large, frequently more or
less spirally arcuate, and directed outwards. There is
no proof that they differ much according to differences
of sex or race. The size was not much greater than
that to which the Indian species may attain; it appears
to have been still clumsier in its proportions. It is already
manifest from its osseous remains, that it was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511"></a>[511]</span>
species differing more from the Indian, than the ass from
the horse, and the jackal and isatis from the wolf and
fox. It is not known what had been the size of its ears,
or the colour of its skin; but it is certain that, at least,
some individuals bore two sorts of hair, namely, a red,
coarse, tufted wool, and stiff black hairs, which, upon
the neck and along the dorsal spine, became long enough
to form a sort of mane. Thus, not only is there nothing
impossible in its having been able to support a climate
which would destroy the Indian species, but it is even
probable that it was so constituted as to prefer cold climates.
Its bones are generally found in the alluvial
and superficial strata of the earth, and most commonly
in the deposits which fill up the bottom of valleys, or
which border the beds of rivers. They scarcely ever occur
by themselves, but are confusedly mingled with
bones of other quadrupeds of known genera, such as
rhinoceroses, oxen, antelopes, horses, and frequently
with remains of marine animals, particularly conchiferous
species, some of which have even been found
adhering to them. The positive testimony of Pallas,
Fortis, and many others, does not allow us to doubt that
this latter circumstance has frequently taken place, although
it is not always observed. We ourselves have at
this moment under our eyes a portion of a jaw covered
with millepores and small oysters.</p>

<p>The strata which cover the bones of elephants are
not of very great thickness, and they are scarcely ever
of a rocky nature. They are seldom petrified, and
there are only one or two cases recorded in which they
were found imbedded in a shelly or other rock. Frequently
they are simply accompanied with our common<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512"></a>[512]</span>
fresh water shells. The resemblance, in this latter respect,
as well as with regard to the nature of the soil, between
the three places, of which we have the most detailed
accounts, viz. <em>Tonna</em>, <em>Cantstadt</em>, and the <em>Forest
of Bondi</em>, is very remarkable. Every thing, therefore,
seems to announce that the cause which has buried
them, is one of the most recent of those that have contributed
to change the surface of the globe. It is nevertheless
a physical and general cause; the bones of <em>fossil
elephants</em> are so numerous, and have been found
in places so desert and even uninhabitable, that we
cannot suppose that they had been conducted there
by man. The strata which contain them and those
which are above them, shew, that this cause was aqueous,
or that it was water that covered them; and in
many places these waters were nearly the same as those
of our present sea, since they supported animals nearly
the same. But, it was not by these waters that they
were transported to the places where they now are.
Bones of this description have been found in almost
every country that has been examined by naturalists.
An irruption of the sea that might have brought them
from places which the <em>Indian elephant</em> now inhabits,
could not have scattered them so far, nor dispersed
them so equably. Besides, the inundation which buried
them has not risen above the great chains of mountains,
since the strata which it has deposited, and which cover
the bones, are only found in plains of little elevation.
It is not, therefore, seen how the carcases of elephants
could have been transported into the north, across the
mountains of <em>Thibet</em>, and the <em>Altaic</em> and <em>Uralian</em>
chains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_513"></a>[513]</span></p>

<p>Further, these bones are not rolled; they retain their
ridges and apophyses; they have not been worn by friction.
Very frequently the epiphyses of those which had
not yet attained their full growth, are still attached to
them, although the slightest effort would suffice to detach
them. The only alterations that are remarked,
arise from the decomposition which they have undergone
during their abode in the earth. Nor can it with more
reason be represented that the entire carcases had been
violently transported. In this case, the bones would indeed
have remained entire; but they would also have
remained together, and would not have been scattered.
The shells, millepores, and other marine productions
which are attached to some of these bones, prove besides
that they had remained at least some time stripped
and separated at the bottom of the fluid which covered
them. The elephants’ bones had therefore already been
in the places in which they are found, when the fluid
covered them. They were scattered about in the same
manner as in our own country the bones of horses and
other animals that inhabit it may be, and as the dead bodies
are spread in the fields.</p>

<p>Every circumstance, therefore, renders it extremely
probable, that the elephants which have furnished the
fossil bones, dwelt and lived in the countries where their
bones are at present found. They could only, therefore,
have disappeared by a revolution, which had destroyed
all the individuals then living, or by a change of climate,
which prevented them from propagating. But whatever
this cause may have been, it must have been sudden.
The bones and ivory which are found in so perfect a
state of preservation in the plains of Siberia, are only so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_514"></a>[514]</span>
preserved by the cold which congeals them there, or which,
in general, arrests the action of the elements upon them.
If this cold had come on by degrees and slowly, these
bones, and still more the soft parts with which they are
still sometimes invested, would have had time to decompose,
like those which occur in warm and temperate countries.
It would especially have been impossible that an
entire carcase, like that discovered by Mr Adams, could
have retained its flesh and skin without corruption, if it
had not been immediately enveloped by the ice which
preserved it. Thus, all the hypotheses of a gradual
cooling of the earth, or of a slow variation, whether in
the inclination or in the position of the axis of the globe,
fall to be rejected.</p>

<p>If the present <em>elephants</em> of <em>India</em> were the descendants
of these ancient elephants, which have been preserved
in that climate to the present day, from their being
there placed beyond the reach of the catastrophe
which destroyed them in the others, it would be impossible
to explain why their species has been destroyed in
America, where remains are still found, which prove
that they had formerly existed there. The vast empire
of Mexico presented to them heights enough to escape
from an inundation so little elevated as that which we
must suppose to have taken place, and the climate there
is warmer than is requisite for their temperament.</p>

<p>The various <em>mastodons</em>, the <em>hippopotamus</em> and the <em>fossil
rhinoceros</em> lived in the same countries, and in the same
districts, as the <em>elephants</em>, since their bones are found in
the same strata and in the same state. Yet these animals
very assuredly no longer exist. Every thing therefore,
Cuvier maintains, concurs to induce a belief that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_515"></a>[515]</span>
the <em>fossil elephant</em> is, like them, an extinct species, although
it resembles more than they one of the species at
present existing, and that its extinction has been produced
by a sudden cause, by the same great catastrophe
which destroyed the species of the same epoch.</p>


<h4>3. <em>On the Great Mastodon, or Animal of the Ohio.</em></h4>

<p>It appears that the <em>Great Mastodon</em> or <em>Animal of the
Ohio</em>, was very like the elephant in its tusks and whole
skeleton, the grinders excepted; that it very probably had
a proboscis; that its height did not exceed that of the elephant,
but that it was a little more elongated, and had
limbs somewhat thicker, with a more slender belly. Notwithstanding
all these points of resemblance, the peculiar
structure of its grinders is sufficient to constitute it of a
different genus from the elephant. It further appears,
that it fed much in the same manner as the hippopotamus
and boar, choosing by preference the roots and other fleshy
parts of vegetables; that this sort of food must have
drawn it towards the soft and marshy places; that, nevertheless,
it was not formed for swimming, and living often
in the water like the hippopotamus, but that it was a true
land animal. Its bones are much more common in North
America than any where else. They are even perhaps
exclusively confined to that country. They are better preserved,
and fresher, than any other fossil bones known;
and, nevertheless, there is not the slightest proof, the smallest
authentic testimony, calculated to impress a belief that
either in America, or any where else, there is still any
living individual, for the various accounts which we have
from time to time read in the journals respecting living
mastodons, which had been observed in the forests or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_516"></a>[516]</span>
plains of that vast continent, have never been confirmed,
and can only pass for fables.</p>

<h3 class="fs70">ON THE CAVES IN WHICH BONES OF CARNIVOROUS ANIMALS
OCCUR IN GREAT QUANTITIES.</h3>

<p>The extraordinary accumulations of fossil bones in
caves and caverns in different districts, especially in those
composed of limestone, have for many years engaged
the attention of inquirers; and, of late, have afforded
many interesting facts to the geologist and zoologist. In
England, as will appear from the following details, many
different fossil animals have been discovered in limestone
caves; but hitherto the caves in Scotland, which will
probably be found to contain interesting documents of an
ancient population, have not been examined. As the
subject is a curious and interesting one, we shall, in the
following pages, principally from Cuvier’s great work,
lay before our readers a pretty full account of the different
caves, especially those that afford bones of carnivorous
animals.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Numerous caves, brilliantly decorated with stalactites
of every form, succeeding each other to a great depth in
the interior of mountains, communicating together by
openings so narrow as scarcely to allow a man to enter
them crawling, and which are yet found strewed with an
enormous quantity of bones of large and small animals,
are without dispute among the most remarkable phenomena
which the history of fossil remains could present to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_517"></a>[517]</span>
the contemplation of the geologist, especially when we reflect
that this phenomenon recurs in a great number of
places, and over a very extended space of country.
These caves have been the object of research of several
naturalists, some of whom have well described and
figured the bones which they contain; and even before
they were explored by the naturalist, they were celebrated
among the common people, who, according to their
custom, added many imaginary prodigies to the natural
wonders which are really observed in them. The bones
which they contain were long, under the name of <em>fossil
unicorn</em>, an important article of commerce and materia
medica, on account of the powerful virtues which were
attributed to them; and it is probable that the desire of
finding these bones contributed much to the more accurate
knowledge of these caves, and even to the discovery
of several of them.</p>

<p>The most anciently celebrated is the cave of <em>Bauman</em>,
situated in the country of <em>Blankenburg</em>, which belongs
to the Duke of Brunswick, to the south of the city of that
name, to the east of <em>Elbingerode</em>, and to the north of the
village of <em>Rubeland</em>, the nearest inhabited place, in a hill
which forms one of the last declivities of the <em>Hartz</em> toward
the east. It has been described by many authors,
among whom we shall particularly mention the great
<em>Leibnitz</em>, in his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Protogæa</cite>, pl. i. p. 97, where he gives a
map of it, borrowed from the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acta Eruditorum</cite> 1702,
p. 305.</p>

<p>Its general direction is east and west, but the entrance
faces the north. It is very narrow, although it is under
a pretty large natural vault. The first cave is the
largest. From this to the second, one must descend by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_518"></a>[518]</span>
another narrow passage, at first by creeping, and afterwards
by a ladder. The difference of level is 30 feet.
The second cave is the richest in stalactite of all forms.
The passage to the third cave is at first the most difficult
of all, and we have to climb with hands and feet; but it
afterwards enlarges, and the stalactites of its walls are
those in which the imagination of the curious has pretended
to see the best characterized figures. It has two
lateral dilatations, of which the map of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acta Eruditorum</i>
makes the third and fourth caves. At its extremity,
we have still to ascend, in order to arrive at the real
third cave, which forms a sort of portal. <em>Behrens</em> says,
in his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hercynia curiosa</cite>, that it cannot be reached, because
it would be necessary to descend more than 60 feet;
but the above mentioned map, and the description of <em>Von
der Hardt</em>, which accompanies it, describe this third cave
under the name of the Fifth, and place beyond it a
narrow passage, terminated by two small grottoes. Lastly,
<em>Silberschlag</em>, in his <cite>Geogony</cite>, adds, that one of these
grottoes leads to a narrow passage, which, descending
much, leads under the other caves, and terminates in
a place filled with water. There are still many bones in
these remote and little frequented parts. Most of those
bones which are in collections from this cave, or which
have been described, are of the bear genus.</p>

<p>A second cave, nearly as celebrated as the former, and
very near, is that which is named, after the <em>unicorn,
Enihornshæle</em>, at the foot of the chateau of <em>Scharzfels</em>,
in a part of the Electorate of Hanover which is named
the Dutchy of <em>Grubenhagen</em>, and nearly upon the last
southern declivity of the <em>Hartz</em>. It has also been described
by <em>Leibnitz</em>, as well as by <em>M. Deluc</em>, in his Letters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_519"></a>[519]</span>
to the Queen of England. The entrance is 10 feet high,
and 7 broad. We descend vertically 15 feet into a sort
of vestibule, the roof of which lowers to such a degree,
that, at the end of 60 feet, we are obliged to creep.
After a long passage, we come to two other caves, according
to Leibnitz; but Behrens adds three or four,
and says, that, according to the country people, we
might penetrate nearly two leagues.</p>

<p><em>Bruckmann</em>, who gives a map of this cavern (<em>Epistol.
Itin.</em> p. 34.), represents only five caves, arranged nearly
in a straight line, and connected by extremely narrow
passages. The second is the richest in bones; the third,
which is the most irregular, has two small lateral caves;
the fifth is the smallest, and contains a fountain. Of the
bones which have been taken from it, some are in the
possession of M. Blumenbach and other naturalists; and
others have been figured by <em>Leibnitz</em> and <em>Mylius</em>. They
belong to the bear, hyena, and tiger or lion genera.</p>

<p>The chain of the Hartz also presents some other caves
of less celebrity, although of the same nature mentioned
by Behrens in his Hercynia curiosa, namely,</p>

<p>The cave of <em>Hartzburg</em>, under the castle of the
same name, above <em>Goslar</em> to the south. We do not know
why Büsching disputes its existence. It is true that
Behrens cites J. D. Horstius erroneously, for having seen
bones of various animals taken from it; for Horstius
speaks only (<cite>Obs. Anat. dec.</cite> p. 10.) of the cave of <em>Scharzfels</em>.</p>

<p>The cave of <em>Ufftrungen</em>, in the county of <em>Stollberg</em>,
to the south of the castle of that name. It is named in
the country <em>Heim-knohle</em>, or <em>Hiding-hole</em>. Behrens
thinks that fossil bones might be found in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_520"></a>[520]</span></p>

<p>Another cave of the same neighbourhood, is named
<em>Diebsloch, Thieves’ Hole</em>. Skulls have been found in it,
which were supposed to be human.</p>

<p>We shall not speak here of those caves of the Hartz in
which bones have not been discovered. And even those
in which they have been found, are, at the present day,
almost exhausted, it being only by breaking the stalactite
that any can be obtained, so much of them had been
taken away for selling as medicines.</p>

<p>The caves of <em>Hungary</em> come after those of the Hartz,
with reference to the remoteness of the time at which
they have been known. The first notice of them is due
to <em>Paterson Hayn</em>, (Ephem. Nat. Cur. 1672, Obs.
cxxxix. and cxciv.) <em>Bruckmann</em>, a physician of <em>Wolfenbüttel</em>,
afterwards described them at length. (<em>Epistola Itineraria</em>,
77, and <em>Breslauer Sammlung</em>, 1725, First Trim.
p. 628.) They are situated in the county of <em>Liptow</em>,
on the southern declivities of the <em>Carpathian mountains</em>.
They are known in the country by the name of <em>Dragons’
Caves</em>, because the people of the neighbourhood
attribute to those animals the bones which occur in them,
and with which they have been acquainted from time
immemorial; but all those which have been figured by
authors belong to the Bear family, and to the species
which is named the <em>Great Cave Bear</em> (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grand Ours des
cavernes</i>).</p>

<p>The caves of Germany the richest in bones are those
of <em>Franconia</em>, of which <em>J. F. Esper</em>, a clergyman of the
country of <em>Bayreuth</em>, has given a very detailed description
in a work, printed in French and German, entitled,
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Description des Zoolithes nouvellement decouvertes</cite>,
&amp;c. <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nuremberg Knorr.</cite> 1774, folio, with 14 coloured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_521"></a>[521]</span>
plates, and in a memoir inserted among those of the
<cite>Berlin Society of Naturalists</cite>, vol. ix. 1784, p. 56.
Another description was afterwards given, under the
title of <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Objets dignes de remarque des environs de Muggendorf</cite>,
by J. C. Rosenmüller, folio, with coloured
views, Berlin, 1804. And more lately, M. Goldfuss, at
present Professor of Natural History at Bonn, and Secretary
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Academia Naturæ Curiosorum</i>, has made
them the subject of a particular work printed in 1810
in German, under the title of <cite>Environs of Muggendorf</cite>,
in which he describes them with the greatest care, as
well as the surrounding country, of which he gives a
very correct topographical chart. A great part of these
caves is situated in a small bailiwick, named <em>Streitberg</em>,
which was formerly a dependence upon the country of
<em>Bayreuth</em>, but was inclosed in that of <em>Bamberg</em>, and
now forms part of the kingdom of Bavaria. The greatest
number occur in a small peninsula, formed by the
river of <em>Wiesent</em>, which falls into the Pegnetz, and belongs
to the basin of the <em>Main</em>.</p>

<p>However, the chief of all these astonishing caves, those
of <em>Gaylenreuth</em>, are beyond the limits of this peninsula,
being on the left bank of the Wiesent, to the north-west
of the village from which it derives its name. The entrance
is perforated in a vertical rock; it is 7½ feet high, and
faces the east. The first cave turns to the right, and is
upwards of 80 feet long. The unequal heights of the vault
divide it into four parts; the first three are from 15 to
20 feet high, the fourth is only 4 or 5. At the bottom of
this latter, on the level of the floor, there is a hole 2 feet
high, which affords a passage to the second cave: it has
first a direction to the south, over a length of 60 feet by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_522"></a>[522]</span>
40 in breadth, and 18 in height; it then turns to the west
for 70 feet, becoming lower and lower until at length
the height is only 5 feet. The passage which leads to
the third cave is very inconvenient, and one has to turn
through <ins class="corr" id="tn-522" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'various corridores'">
various corridors</ins>: it is 30 feet across, and from
5 to 6 in height. The ground in it is kneaded with
teeth and jaws. Near the entrance is a pit of from 15
to 20 feet, to which one descends by a ladder. After
having descended, we come to a vault of 15 feet diameter
by 30 in height; and towards the side at which the
descent is made there is a cave strewed with bones. On
still descending a little, a new arcade is met with, which
leads to a cave 40 feet long, and a new pit of from
18 to 20 feet deep. After descending this, we reach
a cavern about 40 feet high, all strewed with bones.
A passage, of 5 feet by 7, leads to a grotto of 25 feet in
length by 12 in breadth. Canals, 20 feet in length, conduct
to another grotto of 20 feet in height. Lastly,
there is another cave, 83 feet broad and 24 high, in
which more bones are found than in any of the others.</p>

<p>The sixth cave, which is the last, has a northerly direction,
so that the whole series of caves and passages
nearly describes a semicircle.</p>

<p>A fissure in the third cave led to the discovery, in
1784, of a new cave, 15 feet long and 4 broad, in which
the greatest quantities of hyena and lions’ bones were
found. The aperture was much too small for these animals
to have passed through it. A particular canal
which ended in this small cave has afforded an incredible
number of bones and large skulls entire.</p>

<p>In the Philosophical Transactions of 1822, pl. xxvi.
there may be seen a profile of this cave, taken on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_523"></a>[523]</span>
spot in 1816, by Professor Buckland, in which is to be
especially remarked an enormous mass, entirely composed
of bones enveloped in the stalactite, and thus forming
an osseous breccia, but of quite a different nature
from those which occur at Gibraltar and other places<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>.</p>

<p>The cave of <em>Gaylenreuth</em> is one of those the bones of
which are most completely known, by the researches
which have been made or caused to be made in it for a
long time back by distinguished naturalists, such as
MM. Esper, de Humboldt, Ebel of Bremen, Rosenmüller,
Sœmmering, Goldfuss, &amp;c., and by the numerous
and rich collections which these researches have produced.
According to the examination which Cuvier has
made of the principal of these collections, three-fourths
of the bones found there belong to the Bear genus, and
to two or three species of that genus. The others belong
to the hyena, tiger, wolf, fox, glutton, and polecat,
or some nearly allied species. There are also found, although
in much smaller number, bones of herbivorous
quadrupeds, and, in particular, deer, of which fragments
are in the possession of M. Ebel. It would even appear
from a passage of M. Sœmmering’s, that a parcel
of bones had been got in it belonging to an elephant’s
skull<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>. According to Rosenmüller, there were
found in it bones of men, horses, oxen, sheep, deer,
roes, mules, badgers, dogs, and foxes, but which from
the researches made by him in the cave itself, and from
their state of preservation, must have been deposited at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_524"></a>[524]</span>
periods much later than those of the bear, tigers and
hyenas<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>.</p>

<p>The small peninsula situate nearly opposite to this cave,
presents several other caves, as the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schœnstein</i>, or <em>Beautiful
Rock</em>, which contains seven contiguous caverns. The
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Brunnenstein</i>, or <em>Fountain Rock</em>, in which, according to
Esper, there are only found bones of known species,
such as badgers, dogs, foxes, hogs, and deer; but Esper
had too little anatomical knowledge for his testimony to
be entirely relied on with respect to this. These bones
are sometimes encrusted with stalactite. It contains also
the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Holeberg</i>, or <em>Hollow Mountain</em>, in which eight or
ten caves form a series of 200 feet in length, with two
entrances. Bones of the same bears as at <em>Gaylenreuth</em>,
are found here in various lateral depressions; and there
are also deer and hogs.&mdash;The <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wizerloch</i>, so named from
an ancient Sclavonic deity formerly worshipped there,
the most dismal cavern of the whole country, situate in
its most elevated part, and in which some vertebræ have
been found. It is more than 200 feet long. The
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wunderhœhle</i>, which takes its name from its discoverer,
has been known since 1773: its extent is 160 feet.&mdash;Lastly,
the Cave of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Klaustein</i>, consisting of four grottoes,
and upwards of 200 feet deep. Bones have been found
in the third grotto, and most abundantly towards its extremity.
It might be supposed that the name <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Klaustein</i>
signified <em>Claw-rock</em>, and it would thus accord very well
with a place where, without doubt, as at Gaylenreuth,
a multitude of ungual phalanges of bears and animals of
the tiger kind have been found. But M. Goldfuss asserts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_525"></a>[525]</span>
that it was called <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Klaustein</i>, or <em>St Nicholas’s
Rock</em>, after a chapel of this name, which formerly stood
upon it.&mdash;There are still the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geiss-knok</i>, or <em>Goat Cave</em>,
and a cave discovered in 1793. M. Rosenmüller found
in them two human skeletons already covered with stalactite.</p>

<p>The country which surrounds this small peninsula
has itself several caves, independently of that of <em>Gaylenreuth</em>,
as those of <em>Mockas</em>, <em>Rabenstein</em>, and <em>Kirch-ahorn</em>,
three villages, situate, the first to the south, and the
other two to the north-east of Gaylenreuth. Bones were
formerly found in the first. The last bears in the country
the expressive name of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zahn-loch</i>, or <em>Tooth Cave</em>;
it also bears the name of <em>Hohen-mirschfeld</em>, a village on
whose ground it is situate; and the country people
have long been in the habit of seeking in it those bones,
which they imagined to be medicinal. MM. Rosenmüller
and Goldfuss have in fact found bear and tiger bones.
There are two others in the territory of the same village,
of which the one named <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schneider-loch</i> (<em>Tailor’s Hole</em>),
is said to have furnished the vertebræ of an elephant.
That of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zewig</i>, close upon <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Waschenfeld</i>, at the very
edge of the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiesent</i>, is nearly 80 feet deep; and it is said
that skeletons of men and wolves were found in it.</p>

<p>All these hills, containing caves in their interior, and
situate so near each other, seem to form a small chain,
interrupted only by brooks, and which joins the more
elevated chain of the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fichtelberg</i>, in which are the
highest mountains of Franconia, and from which flow
the <em>Main</em>, the <em>Saale</em>, the <em>Eger</em>, the <em>Naab</em>, and many
small rivers. M. Rosenmüller, and after him, others
assert, that those which are in the hills to the north of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_526"></a>[526]</span>
the <em>Wiesent</em>, contain not a single fragment of bone, while
those to the south are filled with them.</p>

<p>In 1799, a cave, remarkable for its situation, was discovered,
which connects in some measure those of the
<em>Hartz</em> with those of <em>Franconia</em>. It is the Cave of
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Glücksbrun</i>, in the bailiwick of <em>Altenstein</em>, in the territory
of <em>Meinungen</em>, on the south-western declivity of
the chain of the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Thuringerwald</cite> (Blumenb. <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Archæol.
Telluris</cite>, p. 15. <em>Zach. Monate. Corresp. 1800, January</em>,
p. 30.) It is the same which M. Rosenmüller names
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Libenstein</i>, on account of its being on the road from <em>Altenstein</em>
to this latter, which is a bathing place. There
is a description of it by M. Kocher, in the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Magazin für
Mineralogie</cite>, by M. C. E. A. De Hof, 1st band. heft. iv.
p. 427. The limestone in which it is situate rests upon
bituminous schist, and, rising much upwards, comes to
rest upon primitive rocks. The limestone varies in
hardness and in the nature of its fracture, and contains
marine petrifactions, such as pectinites, echinites, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In making a road, there was discovered an opening,
from which a very cold air issued, which determined the
Duke of Saxe-Meinungen to have it farther examined.
A narrow passage, of twenty feet in length, was found,
which led to a cave of thirty-five feet, having a breadth
of from three to twelve, and a height of from six to
twelve, according to the places, and terminated by a
large piece of rock, which was removed. The labour of
two years discovered and cleared a series of caves connected
together, and of which the bottom rose and fell
alternately. They terminate in a place where water
flows; but various lateral fissures make it probable that
there are still several caves which have not been opened,
and that they perhaps form a sort of labyrinth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_527"></a>[527]</span></p>

<p>The bottom and walls of this cave are furnished with
the same mud as the others, but blacker. The bones
were pretty numerous, and tinged with the same colour,
but only two tolerably entire skulls were obtained.
That of which M. Kocher gives a figure, is the species
of bear named <em>Ursus spelæus</em>. There are also caves of
this kind in Westphalia. J. Es Silberschlag, in the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mem.
des Naturalistes</cite> of Berlin (<em>Schriften</em>, vol. vi. p. 132),
describes the one called <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kluter-hœhle</i>, near the village of
<em>Oldenforde</em>, in the county of <em>Mark</em>, on the edge of the
<em>Milspe</em> and <em>Ennepe</em>, two streams which fall into the
Ruhr, and with it into the Rhine. Its entrance is about
half-way up a hill called <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kluterberg</i>, is only three feet
three inches high, and faces the south. The cave itself
forms a true labyrinth in the interior of the mountain.</p>

<p>Not far from this, in the same county, at Sundwich,
two leagues from <em>Iserlohn</em>, is another cave, which, for
about twenty-five years back, has furnished a very large
quantity of bones, part of which has been carried to
Berlin, and the rest has remained in the country in the
hands of various individuals<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>.</p>

<p>If we cast a glance upon a general map, it is not difficult
to perceive a certain continuity in the mountains
in which these singular caves occur. The Carpathians
join with the mountains of Moravia and those of Bohemia
called <em>Bœhmerwald</em>, to separate the basin of the
Danube, from those of the Vistula, Oder and Elbe.
The Fichtelgebirge separates the basin of the Elbe from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_528"></a>[528]</span>
that of the Rhine. The Thuringerwald and the Hartz
continue to limit the basin of the Elbe, by separating it
from that of the Weser.</p>

<p>These different chains have but slight intervals between
them. The caves of Westphalia alone are not
connected in so evident a manner with the others.</p>

<p>Very lately, bones have been discovered in a cavern,
which extends more towards the south, and is even
situate on the other or Italian side of the Alps. It
is that of <em>Adelsberg</em> in <em>Carniola</em>, a place situate on
the great road from <em>Laybach</em> to <em>Trieste</em>, and about
half way between these two cities. The whole of this
country is full of caverns and grottoes, which have given
rise to numerous sinkings of the surface, thus giving
a very singular appearance to the country. Several of
these caverns have long been celebrated among naturalists.
That of <em>Adelsberg</em> is generally visited by travellers,
on account of its being near the highway, and because
a river called the <em>Piuka</em> or <em>Poike</em> is lost there,
forming a subterranean lake, and emerging again on the
north side, under the name of <em>Unz</em>. A hole which the
Chevalier de <em>Lowengreif</em> discovered in 1816, in one of
its walls, at the height of 14 fathoms, conducted him to
a series of new caves of vast extent, and of incomparable
beauty, from the lustre and variety of their stalactites.</p>

<p>A part of these caves was, however, known, and must
be, or have been accessible, by some other place, for inscriptions
were found in them with dates, from 1393 to
1676, together with human bones, and entire carcases,
that had been buried there. A German pamphlet was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_529"></a>[529]</span>
published at Trieste, in which are described all the windings
of these subterranean passages, their different halls,
their domes, their columns, and all the other appearances
produced by their stalactites. We shall not follow the
author (M. de <em>Volpi</em>, Director of the School of Commerce
and Navigation at Trieste) through this immense
labyrinth. Let it suffice to say, that this zealous naturalist
asserts his having proceeded more than three leagues,
almost in a straight line, and that he was only stopped
by a lake which rendered it impossible to go on. It was
about two leagues from the entrance that he discovered
bones of animals, of which he gives figures, and which
he describes under the name of Palæotheria. He had
the politeness to communicate to me, says Cuvier, his
drawings the year before, but it appears my reply did
not reach him, for he makes no mention of it in his book.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, his figures clearly shewed that the
bones in question belonged to the great cave-bear. In
fact, several of these bones having been presented to the
Congress of Laybach, <em>Prince Metternich</em>, whose enlightened
taste for the advancement of knowledge has already
been of so much service, had the goodness to address
them to Cuvier, who disposed them in the Royal Cabinet,
where any one may satisfy himself as to their species.</p>

<p>There are, without doubt, caves in many other chains,
and several are known in France. Caves occur in Suabia,
but no bones have been found in them; and, in general,
it appears, that, before the last discoveries, and
especially that which has been made in Yorkshire, none
were known but those of Germany and Hungary that were
rich in bones of carnivora. In truth, the rock of <em>Fouvent</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_530"></a>[530]</span>
and which contains in one of its cavities bones of hyenas,
and at the same time those of elephants, rhinoceroses and
horses, might be considered as belonging to this order of
phenomena; but as it was not explored to any depth, it
cannot be certain that it is so.</p>

<p>The case is different with the <em>Kirkdale</em> Cavern. It having
been visited immediately after its discovery by several
well informed persons, and especially by Mr Buckland,
every thing has been made known with respect to it. It
is situated in the East Riding of the county of York,
twenty-five miles NNE. of the city of <em>York</em>, and at about
the same distance to the west from the sea and the town
of Scarborough. The small river of <em>Hodgebeck</em> is lost under
ground in the neighbourhood, much in the same way
as the <em>Piuka</em>, near <em>Adelsberg</em>. It is placed in one of the
limestone hills which form the northern boundary of the
vale of <em>Pickering</em>, the waters of which fall into the Derwent.
Mr Buckland compares the stone to that of the
last strata of the Alpine limestone, such as are seen near
Aigle and Meillene.</p>

<p>It was in the course of the year 1821, that some labourers
working at a quarry, discovered by chance the
opening, which was closed by rubbish, covered over
with earth and turf. It is about 100 feet above the
neighbouring brook. It can be entered to the distance
of 150 or 200 feet, but we can only walk erect in some
places, on account of the stalactites. On its sides there
are seen spines of sea-urchins and other marine remains,
incrusted in the mass of the rock; but it is on the bottom,
and there only, that there is found the stratum of mud,
of about a foot thick, stuck full of bones, as at Gay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_531"></a>[531]</span>lenreuth.
This mud, and the bones which it contains,
are, in various places, covered or penetrated with stalactite,
especially near places where the rock has lateral
fissures.</p>

<p>The discovery having acquired much celebrity, a great
number of people procured bones from it, and placed
them in various public depots. Specimens have been deposited
in the York Institution, that of Whitby and
Bristol, the British Museum, the Museum of Oxford and
Cambridge, and by Mr Young of Whitby, in the College
Museum of Edinburgh; but the finest collection of the
bones of Kirkdale was presented to Cuvier, and by him deposited
in the Royal Cabinet in Paris. The greatest number
of these bones without comparison, belong to hyenas
of the same species as those of the caverns of Germany;
but there are also many of other large and small animals,
which Mr Buckland supposes to form twenty-one species.
From the pieces which I have under my eye, says
Cuvier, there indisputably occur bones of the <em>elephant</em>,
<em>hippopotamus</em>, <em>horse</em>, an <em>ox</em> of the size of the common
<em>deer</em>, <em>rabbits</em>, <em>field-rats</em>; also bones of some other carnivora,
namely, of the <em>tiger</em>, <em>wolf</em>, <em>fox</em>, and <em>weasel</em>. All
these bones and teeth are accumulated on the ground,
broken and gnawed, and there are even seen marks of the
teeth which have fractured them. There are even intermixed
with them excrements which have been recognized
as perfectly similar to those of the hyena<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_532"></a>[532]</span></p>

<p>The hills in which these caverns occur resemble each
other in their composition: they are all of limestone, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_533"></a>[533]</span>
all produce abundance of stalactites. These stalactites
line the walls, narrow the passages, and assume a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_534"></a>[534]</span>
various forms. The bones are nearly in the same
state in all these caverns: detached, scattered, partly broken,
but never rolled, and consequently not brought from
a distance by water; a little lighter and less solid than
recent bones, but still in their true animal nature, very
little decomposed, containing much gelatine, and not at
all petrified. A hardened, but still easily frangible or
pulverisable earth, also containing animal parts, and
sometimes blackish, forms their natural envelope. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_535"></a>[535]</span>
often impregnated and covered with a crust of stalactite.
A covering of the same nature invests the bones in various
places, penetrates their natural cavities, and sometimes
attaches them to the walls of the cavern. This
stalactite is often coloured reddish by the animal earth
which is mixed with it. At other times its surface is
stained black; but it is easy to see that these appearances
are caused by modern occurrences, and have no immediate
connection with the cause which brought the bones
into these cavities. We even daily see the stalactite increasing
and enveloping here and there groups of bones
which it had formerly respected.</p>

<p>This mass of earth, penetrated by animal matter, indiscriminately
envelopes the bones of all the species; and,
if we except some found at the surface of the ground,
and which had been transported there at much later periods,
which may also be distinguished by their being
much less decomposed, they must all have been interred
in the same manner, and by the same causes. In this
mass of earth there are found, confusedly mingled with
the bones (at least in the cave of Gaylenreuth), pieces
of a bluish marble, of which all the corners are rounded
and blunted, and which appear to have been rolled.
They singularly resemble those which form part of the
osseous brecciæ of <em>Gibraltar</em> and <em>Dalmatia</em>.</p>

<p>Lastly, what further conspires to render this phenomenon
very striking, is, that the most remarkable of these
bones are the same in these caverns, over an extent of
more than two hundred leagues. Three-fourths and upwards
belong to species of <em>bears</em>, which are now extinct.
A half, or two-thirds of the remaining fourth, belong to
a species of <em>hyena</em>, which is equally unknown at the pre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_536"></a>[536]</span>sent
day. A smaller number belong to a species of the
<em>tiger</em> or <em>lion</em> kind, and to another of the <em>wolf</em> or <em>dog</em> genus;
lastly, the most diminutive have belonged to various
small carnivora, as the <em>fox</em>, the <em>polecat</em>, or at least
species very nearly allied to them, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Kirkdale Cavern, however, forms a notable exception,
inasmuch as none, or very few, bones of bears
are found in it, and in its being the hyena that appears
to predominate among the carnivora.</p>

<p>The species so common in the alluvial formations, the
<em>elephants</em>, <em>rhinoceroses</em>, <em>horses</em>, <em>oxen</em> or <em>aurochs</em>, and
<em>tapirs</em>, are of very rare occurrence in the caves of Germany.
There are even some in which no one is said to
have found them, and the only bones of herbivora mentioned
are remains of deer. In this point also, however,
the Kirkdale cave differs much from the others, inasmuch
as it abounds almost as much in bones of large
and small herbivora, as in bones of carnivora. All the
great pachydermata of the alluvial formations are seen
in it: the elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotami. There
are also seen in it bones of oxen, deer, and even small
bones of mice and birds. But there are no bones of marine
animals of any species, either at Kirkdale or in Germany.
Those who have pretended that they saw bones
of <em>seals</em>, <em>morses</em>, or other similar species, have been led
into error by the hypothesis which they had previously
adopted.</p>

<p>These bones of carnivora, so numerous in the caves, are
rare in the great alluvial strata; the hyena alone has
been seen in any quantity at Canstadt, near Aichstedt,
and in some other places. There have also been found
some traces of bears in Tuscany and Austria, but their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_537"></a>[537]</span>
relative proportion is always infinitely less than in the
caves; and it is always sufficiently proved by these circumstances,
that these various animals have lived together
in the same countries, and have belonged to the
same epoch.</p>

<p>Cuvier concludes, there can only be imagined three general
causes which might have placed these bones in such
quantity in these vast subterranean cavities. Either they
are the remains of animals which inhabited these abodes,
and which died peaceably there; or inundations and other
violent causes have carried them into these cavities; or,
lastly, they had been enveloped in rocky strata, the dissolution
of which produced these caverns, and they have
not been dissolved by the agent which carried off the matter
of the strata.</p>

<p>This last cause is refuted by the fact, that the strata
in which the caves occur contain no bones; and the second
by the entireness of the smallest prominences of the
bones, which does not permit us to think that they had
been rolled; for if some bones are worn, as Mr Buckland
has remarked, they are only so on one side, which would
only prove that some current has passed over them, and
in the deposit in which they are. We are, therefore, obliged
to have recourse to the first supposition, whatever
difficulties it presents on its part, and to say that these
caves served as a retreat to carnivorous animals, and that
these carried there, for the purpose of devouring them,
the animals which formed their prey, or the parts of these
animals.</p>

<p>Mr Buckland has observed, that the hyena bones are
not less broken and splintered than those of the herbivorous
animals; from which he concludes, that the hyenas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_538"></a>[538]</span>
had devoured the dead bodies of their own species, as
those of the present day still do.</p>

<p>These animals attack each other during their life; for
the fossil head of a hyena is preserved, which had evidently
been wounded and afterwards healed<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_539"></a>[539]</span></p>

<p>This supposition is moreover confirmed by the animal
nature of the earth in which these bones are found<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>.</p>

<p>This much is certain, that the establishment of these
animals in the caves has taken place at a much later
epoch than that at which the great rocky strata have been
formed, not only those which compose the mountains in
which the caves are situated, but the strata of much
newer origin. No permanent inundation has penetrated
into the subterranean dens, and formed a regular rocky
deposit. The mud arising from the proper decomposition
of these animals, and the stalactites that have been
filtered through the wall of the caves, are the only matters
which cover these remains, and these stalactites increase
so rapidly, that M. Goldfuss already found a layer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_540"></a>[540]</span>
of them covering the names of MM. Esper and Rosenmüller,
whose visits did not date thirty years before his
own. The rolled stones that are met with, and the marks
of detrition observed on some bones, announce, at the
very utmost, but passing currents.</p>

<p>But how have so many ferocious animals which peopled
our forests been extirpated? All the reply we can
make is, that they must have been destroyed at the same
time, and by the same cause, as the large herbivora,
which, like them, also peopled these forests, and of which
no traces remain at the present day any more than of
them.</p>


<h3 class="p2 fs70">ACCOUNT OF THE CAVE CONTAINING BONES AT ADELSBERG
IN CARNIOLA.</h3>

<p>The following interesting account of the cave, slightly
noticed at pages <a href="#Page_528">524 and 525</a>, is extracted from a memoir
by M. Bertrand Geslin, Member of the Natural
History Society of Paris, published in the number of the
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales des Sciences Naturelles</cite> for April 1826.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>M. Cuvier, says Gesler, speaking of the Adelsberg
Cave, from the account published by M. Volpi of Trieste,
says, that it was nearly two leagues from the entrance
where he discovered bones of animals.</p>

<p>Having visited this cave myself, I am obliged to say
that M. Volpi’s assertion as to this matter is not very
correct. On my way to Trieste, in July 1823, before
going to Adelsberg, I had the advantage of seeing M.
Volpi. In shewing me the bones collected by him at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_541"></a>[541]</span>
Adelsberg, he also assured me that they were found two
leagues from the entrance of the cave, and only in a very
compact block of several cubic feet, from which it was
not possible to procure more, as he had taken all that he
could easily remove.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this discouraging account, I betook
myself to Adelsberg, in order to see a sample of those
immense caverns of secondary limestone. The entrance
of the cave is situated in a white compact secondary
limestone, lying in great beds inclined to the south-west,
at an angle of from 30 to 35 degrees. At fifty paces from
the entrance, we find ourselves as in a large apartment,
which <ins class="corr" id="tn-541" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'crosses the torent'">
crosses the torrent</ins> of the Pinka. After passing to
the left bank of this torrent, we enter a rather low and
not long passage, which leads to a second apartment of
an elongated form. It is here that the line of chambers
truly commences. They are of large but variable dimensions,
and are situated nearly upon a horizontal plane.</p>

<p>On entering this second chamber, I saw that the
ground was formed of a yellow and reddish clayey
mud, from one to two feet thick, and more or less
impregnated and covered with crusts of yellow stalagmites.
In the places where it offered little resistance, I
dug it up with the point of my hammer, and was fortunate
enough to disunite some fragments of bone, although,
from what had been said to me, I ought not to
have expected to find them. From this I was convinced,
that if M. Volpi had only found bones at a distance of
two leagues from the entrance, it was because he had
not been at the trouble to search for them nearer. I
fell to work with more ardour, and succeeded in digging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_542"></a>[542]</span>
up some in good preservation, such as radii, cubiti, femora,
humeri, fragments of jaws, calcarea, toes, vertebræ,
&amp;c., belonging to bears of different sizes, of the
species termed <em>Ursus spelæus</em>. It would appear that
the hyena tribe is rather rare here, for I only procured
a single bone belonging to it. It was particularly in
two small lateral chambers, near the narrow passage,
that I obtained a great quantity of these bones, the clay
there having been dug up by the guides, in order to
make the floor of the great apartment even with it.</p>

<p>I continued to dig as I advanced, and everywhere
found bones more or less broken and enveloped in the
clayey mud. After proceeding for half an hour, I fell
in with a mass, in an apartment of considerable dimensions,
which was of a conical form, and composed of
blocks of compact white limestone, of all sizes, mixed
with yellowish clayey mud. These blocks had their
edges as sharp as if they had only been lately broken.
The mass, which reached to the right wall of the cave,
might be fifteen feet in height, and twenty in diameter
at its base: it was covered with stalactite in several
places. It was in this mass, at about ten feet above the
floor of the cave, in the clayey mud that filled up the
interstices between the blocks, that I found the entire
skeleton of a young bear, in a space of two square feet
at most. The bones which I dug out were the frontal
part of the head, the lower jaw of the left side, the
seventh cervical and eighth dorsal vertebræ; the eighth
and fourteenth ribs of the right side; two tibia, femora,
and cubiti, and two large canine teeth of another bear.
If I could have raised up the limestone blocks, between
which these bones lay, I might without doubt have pro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_543"></a>[543]</span>cured
a great part of this skeleton. There are still
found here and there in the cave some small heaps of
clayey mud, with fragments of white secondary limestone,
as well as large isolated limestone blocks, which
the guides are daily destroying, to make the floor even
for the convenience of visitors.</p>

<p>I had only advanced an hour and a quarter’s progress
into the cave, always finding bones, when the oil of my
lamps beginning to fail, I was obliged to return without
reaching the block in which M. Volpi had found the
first bones. This block is without doubt owing to the
same causes as the heap of which I have spoken above.</p>

<p>The manner in which these heaps exist, being composed
of blocks of compact white secondary limestone, similar
to that which forms the walls of the cave, with
sharp edges, and piled upon each other, made me imagine
that they might have fallen from the roof. As I
returned, I examined the ceiling of the vaults with attention.
As it was all covered over with stalactites, I
could not discover any fissure.</p>

<p>From this short excursion in the Adelsberg cave, I
am induced to believe, that the bones exist along the
whole extent of the cave, and that they occur in two different
ways; <em>1st</em>, scattered in the clayey mud which forms
the floor of the chambers; and, <em>2dly</em>, buried in heaps
formed of blocks of white secondary compact limestone,
and yellow clayey mud.</p>

<p>The hypothesis which M. Cuvier admits as the most
probable for explaining the presence of these bones in
the caves, is that which would make these caves to have
served as a retreat to carnivorous animals.</p>

<p>The presence of bones in the clayey mud of the floor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_544"></a>[544]</span>
of the Adelsberg cave accords well with this hypothesis;
but the case is different with those which I found in the
heaps of limestone blocks and clayey mud. The bones
are not at the surface of the heap, but rather towards its
middle part, buried among the blocks, and crushed by
them. From this position, and the height at which the
skeleton mentioned above occurs from the floor of the
cave, it cannot be supposed that it formed part of the
bones with which the bottom of the cave is strewed, nor
that the blocks had fallen upon it. The bones contained
in the heap in question must have been brought into
their present position at the same time, and by the same
cause as the limestone blocks. They could not, therefore,
have belonged to animals which inhabited these
caves, and died there peaceably.</p>

<p>If it be remarked, that these blocks, which are sometimes
very large, heaped up above one another, and mixed
with clayey mud, have their angles perfectly fresh, and
are of the same nature as the limestone of the walls of
the cave, it cannot be admitted that they have been
brought from a distance. This mode of arrangement
could only have been produced by their falling from the
roof of the cave.</p>

<p>The following facts also give support to this opinion.
In the cave of Gaylenreuth, a fissure of the third grotto,
was the means, in 1784, of disclosing a new one, fifteen
feet long and four broad, where the greatest quantity of
hyena or lion bones were found. <em>The aperture was
much too small for these animals to have passed through
it.</em></p>

<p>In a cave discovered in 1824, in the district of Lanark
in Upper Canada, Mr Bigsby observed, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_545"></a>[545]</span>
floor was covered with debris of brown granular limestone,
similar to that of the walls, and that the bones
especially formed a heap there. He thinks that the animal,
whose bones have been found in this cave, was
much too large to have got into it alive or entire.&mdash;<cite>Silliman’s
Journal, June 1825</cite>, p. 354.</p>

<p>It must therefore be also admitted here, either that
the bones could only have got into the cave in the same
manner as the heaps of blocks found in the Adelsberg
cave; that is to say, by falling from the roof, or that the
apertures have been closed since the period at which the
animals were buried.</p>

<p>If it be now considered, <em>1st</em>, That the surface of the
secondary limestone mountains of Carniola is covered
with a layer of reddish clay; and, <em>2dly</em>, That the clayey
mud of the heap in the Adelsberg cave is mineralogically
the same as that which forms the floor of the cave;
may it not be supposed, that the same catastrophe which
produced the heaps in the cave may have, at the same
time, introduced into it the reddish clayey mud of the
surface, which, by extending itself over the floor of the
cave, would have contributed to cover the bones that
were lying there?</p>

<p>Moreover, may it not have been the case, that, after
the caves had been inhabited by the carnivorous animals,
the substances falling from above, and coming from the
surface of the soil, may have carried along with the clayey
mud and the bones of bears, the spoils of large herbivorous
animals, which they may have met with, and
which cannot be supposed to have sought refuge in these
caves during life.</p>

<p>There will, no doubt, be objected to me, that opinion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_546"></a>[546]</span>
which maintains, that the bones of herbivora have been
dragged into the caves by the carnivorous animals. This
might certainly have been the case with regard to small
species, but it is not probable that the bones of large species
could have been introduced in the same manner.</p>

<p>Admitting as certain, at least with regard to the Adelsberg
cave, that the limestone blocks and the bear bones
which accompany them, have fallen from the ceiling, the
phenomenon of caves containing bones would connect itself
pretty well with that of osseous brecciæ in a geological
point of view. As M. Cuvier observes, “The nature
of the rocks which contains the one and the other is
not very different; and, besides, the fissures of caves
being generally pretty wide, the bones would not have
stuck, but would have fallen to the bottom, while those
of the osseous brecciæ being much narrower, and not so
deep, would have retained the bones at no great distance
from the surface of the soil.”</p>

<p>Thus, from the facts observed in the caves of Germany
and England, and from that of the Adelsberg cave,
which I have described above, we may conclude, <em>1st</em>,
That the presence of bones in caves has been produced
at two different periods, which, without doubt, have not
been very distant from each other; the first, that when
the animals inhabited these caves; the other, that when
they had been transported there by a somewhat general
catastrophe; <em>2dly</em>, That the second epoch was contemporaneous
with the osseous brecciæ, and was produced,
like them, by a phenomenon or process of filling up.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> The opinion maintained by some geologists, that certain
strata have been formed in the inclined position in which
they are now found, admitting it true with regard to some
particular strata which might have been crystallized, as Mr
Greenough supposes, like the deposit which encrusts the inside
of vessels, in which water containing gypsum has been
boiled, cannot at least apply to those which contain shells or
rolled stones, which could not have waited, so suspended,
the formation of the cement by which they were to be agglutinated.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> The conjecture of the Marquis de la Place, that the
materials of which the globe is composed, have perhaps existed
at first in the elastic form, and have successively assumed
a liquid consistence on cooling, and have at length
been solidified, is well supported by the recent experiments
of M. Mitscherlich, who has composed, of all sorts of substances,
and crystallized by the heat of intense furnaces, several
of the mineral species which enter into the composition
of primitive mountains.&mdash;<a href="#NOTE_D">Note D</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> The Travels of Saussure and Deluc present a multitude
of facts of this description. These geologists imagined,
that they could only have been produced by enormous
eruptions. De Buch and Escher have recently employed
themselves upon this subject. The memoir of the
latter, inserted in the Nouvelle Alpina of Steinmüller,
vol. i. presents the general results in a remarkable manner.
The following is a comprehensive view of them:
Such of these blocks as are scattered over the low parts of
Switzerland and Lombardy, come from the Alps, and have
descended along their valleys. They occur every where, and
of all sizes, up to 50,000 cubic feet, over the great extent of
country which separates the Alps from the Jura mountains;
and they rise upon the sides of the latter facing the Alps,
to a height of 4000 feet above the level of the sea. They
are found at the surface, or in the superficial layers of debris,
but not in the strata of sandstone, molasse, or conglomerate,
which fill up almost every where the interval in question.
They are sometimes isolated, sometimes in heaps. The
height of their situation is not connected with their magnitude;
the smaller ones alone appear sometimes a little worn,
but the large ones are not so at all. Those which belong to
the basin of each river are found, upon examination, to be of
the same nature as the mountains of the tops or sides of the
high valleys in which the tributary streams of this river
take their rise. They are already seen in these upper valleys,
and are particularly accumulated at the places which
are situated above some of the contractions of these valleys.
They have passed over the lower hills, when their height has
not been more than 4000 feet; and then they are seen upon
the other side of the ridges, in the cantons between the Alps
and Jura, and even upon the latter itself. It is opposite the
mouths of the valleys of the Alps that they are seen in the
greatest quantity, and at the greatest heights; those of the
intervening spaces have not been carried so high. Among
the chains of the Jura mountains, which are more remote
from the Alps, they are only found in places which are opposite
the openings of the nearer chains.
</p>
<p>
From these facts, the author draws the conclusion, that
the transportation of these blocks has taken place at a period
subsequent to the deposition of the sandstones and conglomerates,
and has perhaps been occasioned by the last of the
revolutions which the globe has experienced. He compares
the transportation in question to that which still takes place
from the agency of torrents; but the objections presented by
the consideration of the great size of the blocks, and the deep
valleys over which they must have passed, appear to us to
militate greatly against this part of his hypothesis.&mdash;<a href="#NOTE_E">Note E</a>.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> It is a common opinion in Sweden, that the level of the
sea is becoming lower, and that many places may even be
forded or passed dry-shod, which were formerly impracticable.
Eminent philosophers have adopted this popular opinion;
and M. von Buch goes so far as to suppose that the
whole of Sweden is gradually rising. But it is singular,
that no one has made, or at least published, a series of accurate
observations, calculated to confirm a fact that had been
announced so long ago, and which would leave no doubt upon
the mind, if, as Linnæus asserts, this difference of level
were so much as four or five feet yearly. <a href="#NOTE_I">Note I</a>.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> Mr Stevenson, in his observations upon the bed of the
German Ocean and British Channel, maintains that the level
of the sea is continually rising, and has been very sensibly
elevated within the last three centuries. Fortis asserts the
same of some parts of the Adriatic sea. But the example
of the Temple of Serapis, near Pouzzola, proves that the
margins of that sea are, in many places, of such a nature as
to be subject to local risings and fallings. On the other
hand, there are thousands of quays, roads, and other works,
made along the sea-side by the Romans, from Alexandria to
Belgium, the relative level of which has never varied.

to be more subject than any other to such an accident, on
account of the prodigious power of the muscles of its neck,
and the frequent use which it makes of them. When the
hyena has laid hold of any thing, it is easier to drag it along

<p><a id="Footnote_86" href="#FNanchor_86" class="label">[86]</a> These skeletons, more or less mutilated, are found near
Port de Moule, on the north-west coast of the mainland of
Guadaloupe, in a kind of slope resting against the steep
edges of the island. This slope is, in a great measure, covered
by the sea at high-water, and is nothing else than a tufa,
formed, and daily augmented, by the very small debris of
shells and corals, which the waves detach from the rocks,
and the accumulated mass of which assumes a great degree
of cohesion in the places that are most frequently left dry.
We find, on examining them with a lens, that several of
these fragments have the same red tint as a part of the
corals contained in the reefs of the island. Formations of
this kind are common in the whole archipelago of the Antilles,
where they are known to the Negroes under the name
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maçonne-bon-dieu</i>. Their augmentation is proportioned
to the violence of the surge. They have extended the plain
of the Cayes to St Domingo, the situation of which has
some resemblance to the Plage du Moule, and there are
sometimes found in it fragments of earthen vessels, and of
other articles of human fabrication, at a depth of twenty
feet. A thousand conjectures have been made, and even
events imagined, to account for these skeletons of Guadaloupe.
But, from all the circumstances of the case, M. Moreau
de Jonnès, correspondent of the Academy of Sciences,
who has been upon the spot, and to whom I am indebted for
the above details, thinks that they are merely bodies of persons
that have perished by shipwreck. They were discovered
in 1805 by M. Manuel Cortès y Campomanès, at that time
a general officer in the service of the colony. General Ernouf,
the governor, caused one to be extracted with much
labour, of which the head, and almost the whole superior
extremities, were wanting. This had been deposited at
Guadaloupe, in the expectation that another and more complete
specimen would be procured, in order to send them together
to Paris, when the island was taken by the English.
Admiral Cochrane having found this skeleton at the headquarters,
sent it to the English Admiralty, who presented it
to the British Museum. It is still in that collection, and
M. Kœnig, Keeper of the Mineralogical Department, has
described it in the Phil. Trans. of 1814, and there I saw it
in 1818. M. Kœnig observes, that the stone in which it is
imbedded, has not been cut to its present shape, but that it
seems to have been simply inserted, in the form of a distinct
nodule, into the surrounding mass. The skeleton is so
superficial, that its presence must have been perceived by
the projection of some of its bones. They still contain some
of their animal matter, and the whole of their phosphate of
lime. The rock being entirely formed of pieces of corals,
and of compact limestone, readily dissolves in nitric acid.
M. Kœnig has detected fragments of <em>Millepora miniacea</em>,
of several madrepores, and of shells, which he compares to
<em>Helix acuta</em> and <em>Turbo pica</em>. This fossil skeleton is represented
in Plate I. More recently, General Donzelot has
caused another of these skeletons to be extracted, which
is now in the Royal Cabinet, and of which a figure is given
in Plate II. It is a body which has the knees bent. A
small portion of the upper jaw, the left half of the lower,
nearly the whole of one side of the trunk and pelvis, and a
large portion of the left upper and lower extremities, are
what remain of it. The rock which contains it, is evidently
a travertin, in which are imbedded shells of the neighbouring
sea, and land-shells, which are still found alive in the
island, namely, the <em>Bulimus guadalupensis</em> of Ferussac.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_101" href="#FNanchor_101" class="label">[101]</a> This supposed diminution of the Black Sea and Sea of
Asoph, has also been attributed to the rupture of the Bosphorus,
which had taken place at the pretended period of
the deluge of Deucalion; and yet, in order to establish the
fact itself, recourse is had to successive diminutions of the
extent attributed to these seas by Herodotus, Strabo, and
others. But it is very obvious, that, if this diminution had
arisen from the rupture of the Bosphorus, it would necessarily
have been completed long before the time of Herodotus,
and even at the period at which Deucalion is supposed
to have lived.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_102" href="#FNanchor_102" class="label">[102]</a> See the Geography of Herodotus by M. Rennel, p. 56.
<em>et seq.</em>; and the Physical Geography of the Black Sea, &amp;c.
by M. Dureau de Lamalle. There is only at present the
small river of Kamennoipost, that could represent the Gerrhus
and Hypacyris, such as they are described by Herodotus.
</p>
<p>
M. Dureau, p. 170, supposes Herodotus to have made the
Borysthenes and Hypanis discharge themselves into the Palus
Mæotis; but Herodotus (in Melpom. liii.) only says
that these two rivers fall together into the same lake, that
is, into the Liman, as at the present day. Herodotus does
not carry the Gerrhus and Hypacyris any farther.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_103" href="#FNanchor_103" class="label">[103]</a> For example, M. Dureau de Lamalle, in his Physical
Geography of the Black Sea, quotes Aristotle (Meteor. lib. i.
cap. 13.) as “apprising us, that, in his time, there still existed
several ancient periods and peripli, attesting that there had
been a canal leading from the Caspian Sea into the Palus Mæotis.”
Now, Aristotle’s words at the place mentioned (Duval’s
edition, i. 545. B.) are merely these: “From the Paropamisus,
descend, among other rivers, the Bactrus, the Choaspes, and
the Araxis, from which the Tanais, which is a branch of it,
takes its origin, into the Palus Mæotis.” Who does not see
that this nonsense, which is neither founded upon peripli nor
periods, is nothing else than the strange idea of Alexander’s
soldiers, who took the Jaxartes or Tanais of the Transoxian for
the Don or Tanais of Scythia? Arrian and Pliny distinguish
these two rivers from each other, but the distinction does not
appear to have been made in the time of Aristotle. How,
then, could such geographers as these furnish us with geological
documents?</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_117" href="#FNanchor_117" class="label">[117]</a> There is a difference of several years among chronologists
with respect to each of these events; but these migrations
form, notwithstanding, the peculiar and very remarkable
feature of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries before
the christian era. Thus, according to the calculations of
Usserius, Cecrops came from Egypt to Athens about 1556
years before Christ; Deucalion settled on Parnassus about
1548; Cadmus arrived from Phenicia at Thebes about
1493; Danaus came to Argos about 1485; and Dardanus
established himself on the Hellespont about 1449. All
these founders of nations must therefore have been nearly
contemporary with Moses, whose migration took place
in 1491. Consult further, regarding the synchronism of
Moses, Danaus and Cadmus, <cite>Diodorus</cite>, lib. xi; in Photius,

followed by Eusebius, is 1796 years before Christ, consequently
several years after Inachus.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_121" href="#FNanchor_121" class="label">[121]</a> Varro places the deluge of Ogyges, which he calls the
<em>first deluge</em>, 400 years before Inachus, and consequently
1600 years before the first Olympiad. This would refer it
to a period of 2376 years before Christ; and the deluge of
Noah, according to the Hebrew text, is 2349, there being
only 27 years of difference. This testimony of Varro is
mentioned by Censorinus, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Die Natali</cite>, cap. xxi. In
reality, Censorinus wrote only 238 years after Christ; and,
it appears, from Julius Africanus, <em>ap. Euseb.</em> Præp. cv. that
Acusilaus, the first author who placed a deluge in the reign
of Ogyges, made this prince cotemporary with Phoronæus,
which would have brought him very near the first Olympiad.
Julius Africanus makes only an interval of 1020
years between the two epochs; and there is even a passage
in Censorinus conformable to this opinion. Some also read
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">erogitium</i> in place of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ogygium</i>, in the passage of Varro, which
we have quoted above from Censorinus. But what would
this be but an Erogitian Cataclysm, of which nobody has
ever heard?</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_122" href="#FNanchor_122" class="label">[122]</a> Neither Homer nor Hesiod knew any thing of the deluge
of Deucalion, any more than that of Ogyges. The first
author, whose works are extant, by whom mention is made of
the former, is Pindar (Od. Olymp. ix.) He speaks of Deucalion
as landing upon Parnassus, establishing himself in the
city of Protogene (first growth or birth), and re-creating
his people from stones; in a word, he relates, but confining
it to a single nation only, the fable afterwards generalized
by Ovid, and applied to the whole human race.
The first historians who wrote after Pindar, namely, Herodotus,
Thucydides, and Xenophon, make no mention of
any deluge, whether of the time of Ogyges, or that of Deucalion,
although they speak of the latter as one of the first
kings of the Hellenes.
</p>
<p>
Plato, in his Timæus, says only a few words of the deluge,
as well as of Deucalion and Pyrrha, in order to commence
the recital of the great catastrophe, which, according
to the priests of Sais, destroyed the Atlantis; but, in these
few words, he speaks of the deluge in the singular number,
as if it had been the only one. He even expressly mentions
farther on, that the Greeks knew only one. He places
the name of Deucalion immediately after that of Phoroneus,
the first of the human race, without making mention
of Ogyges. Thus, with him, it is still a general event, a
true universal deluge, and the only one which had happened.
He regards it, therefore, as identical with that of
Ogyges.
</p>
<p>
Aristotle (Meteor. i. 14.) seems to be the first who considered
this deluge only as a local inundation, which
he places near Dodona and the river Achelous, but near
the Achelous and Dodona of Thessaly. Apollodorus
(Bibl. i. § 7.) restores to the deluge of Deucalion all its
grandeur and mythological character. According to him,
it took place at the period when the age of brass was passing
into the age of iron. Deucalion is the son of Titan
Prometheus, the fabricator of man; he forms anew the human
race of stones; and yet Atlas, his uncle, Phoroneus,
who lived before him, and several other personages anterior
to him, preserve a lengthened posterity.
</p>
<p>
In proportion as we advance toward authors who approach
nearer our own times, we find circumstances of detail
added, which more resemble those related by Moses.
Thus Apollodorus gives Deucalion a great chest as a means of
safety; Plutarch speaks of the pigeons by which he sought
to find out whether the waters had retired; and Lucian, of
the animals of every kind which he had taken with him, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
With regard to the blending of traditions and hypotheses,
by which it has recently been tried to infer the conclusion,
that the rupture of the Thracian Bosphorus was
the cause of Deucalion’s deluge, and even of the opening of
the pillars of Hercules, by making the waters of the
Euxine Sea discharge themselves into the Archipelago,
supposing them to have been much higher and more extended
than they have been since that event, it is not necessary
for us to treat of it in detail, since it has been determined
by the observations of M. Olivier, that if the Black
Sea had been as high as it is imagined to have been, it
would have found several passages for its waters, by hills
and plains less elevated than the present banks of the Bosphorus;
and by those of the Count Andreossy, that had it
one day fallen suddenly in the manner of a cascade by this
new passage, the small quantity of water that could have
flowed at once through so narrow an aperture, would not
only be diffused over the immense extent of the Mediterranean,
without occasioning a tide of a few fathoms, but that
the mere natural inclination necessary for the flowing of
the waters, would have reduced to nothing their excess of
height above the shores of Attica.

(dieu, god), having attacked Chrishna (the Indian Apollo),
at the head of the northern nations (the Scythians, of whom

<em>Pramathesa</em> (Prometheus); and, according to another legend,
he was devoured by the eagle Garuda. These particulars
have been extracted by Mr Wilfort (in his Memoir

Mr Charles Ritter, in his Vestibule of the History of Europe

Deucalion was of foreign origin, and had been brought into
Greece along with the other legends of that part of the Grecian
worship which had come from the north, and which
had preceded the Egyptian and Phenician colonies. But if

</p>
<p>
&mdash;“Having desired my pundit, who is a learned astronomer,
to point out in the heavens the constellation of
Antarmada, he directed me immediately to Andromeda,
which I had taken care not to shew him as a constellation
that I knew. He afterwards brought me a very rare and
curious book, in Sanscrit, in which there was a particular
chapter on the Upanacshatras, or extra-zodiacal constellations,
with figures of Capeya, of Casyape, seated, and holding
a lotus-flower in her hand; of Antarmada, chained,
with the fish near her; and of Parasica, holding the head
of a monster, which he had killed, dropping blood, and
having snakes for hair.”
</p>
<p>
Who does not recognise in this, Perseus, Cepheus, and
Cassiope? But we must not forget that this pundit of
Mr Wilfort’s has become much suspected.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_212" href="#FNanchor_212" class="label">[212]</a> Thus at Dendera, the ancient Tentyris, a city below
Thebes, in the portico of the great temple, the entrance of
which faces the north, there are seen on the ceiling the
signs of the zodiac marching in two bands, one of which
extends along the eastern side, and the other along the opposite
one. Each of the bands is embraced by the figure
of a woman of the same length, the feet of which are toward
the entrance, the head and arms toward the bottom
of the portico; the feet are consequently to the north, and
the heads to the south. (Great Work on Egypt, Antiq. vol.
ix. pl. 20.)
</p>
<p>
The Lion is at the head of the band which is on the western
side; his direction is toward the north, or toward the
feet of the figure of the woman, and his feet are toward the
eastern wall. The Virgin, the Balance, the Scorpion, the
Saggittary and the Capricorn, follow marching in the same
line. The latter is placed toward the bottom of the portico,
and near the hands and head of the large figure of the
woman. The signs of the eastern band commence at the
extremity where those of the other band terminate, and are
consequently directed toward the bottom of the portico, or
toward the arms of the large figure. They have the feet toward
the lateral wall of their own side, and the heads in the
contrary direction to those of the opposite band. The Aquarius
marches first, and is followed by the Fishes, the Ram,
the Bull, and the Twins. The last of the series, which is
the Crab, or rather the Scarabæus, (for this insect is substituted
for the crab in the zodiacs of Egypt), is thrown
to a side upon the legs of the large figure. In the place
which it should have occupied is a globe resting upon
the summit of a pyramid, composed of small triangles,
which represent a sort of rays, and before the base of which
is a large head of a woman with two small horns. A second
scarabæus is placed awry and cross-wise upon the
first band, in the angle which the feet of the large figure
form with the body, and before the space in which the Lion
marches, which is a little behind. At the other end of this
same band, the Capricorn is very near the bottom, or at the
arms of the large figure; and, upon the left band, the Aquarius
is separated to some distance from it. The Capricorn,
however, is not repeated like the Crab. The division of this
zodiac, from the entrance, is therefore made between the
Lion and the Cancer; or if it be thought that the repetition
of the Scarabæus marks a division of the sign, it takes place
in the Crab itself; but that of the lower end is made between
the Capricorn and Aquarius.
</p>
<p>
In one of the inner halls of the same temple, there was
a circular planisphere inscribed in a square, the same that
has been brought to Paris by M. Lelorrain, and which is to
be seen at the Royal Library. In it, also, the signs of the
zodiac are observed among many other figures which appear
to represent constellations. (Great Work on Egypt,
Antiq. vol. iv. pl. 21.) The Lion corresponds to one of the
diagonals of the square; the Virgin, which follows, corresponds
to a perpendicular line which is directed toward the
east; the other signs march in the usual order, till we come
to the Crab, which, in place of completing the chain, by
corresponding to the level of the Lion, is placed above it,
nearer the centre of the circle, in such a manner that the
signs are upon a somewhat spiral line. This Crab, or rather
Scarabæus, marches in a contrary direction to the other
signs. The Twins correspond to the north, the Sagittary to
the south, and the Fishes to the east, but not very exactly.
At the eastern side of this planisphere is a large figure of a
woman, with the head directed toward the south, and the
feet toward the north, like that of the portico. Some doubt
might therefore also be raised regarding the point at which
the series of the signs ought to commence. According as
one of the perpendiculars or one of the diagonals is taken,
or the place where one part of the series passes over the
other part, the division will be judged to be at the Lion, or
between the Lion and the Crab; or lastly at the Twins.
</p>
<p>
At Esne, the ancient Latopolis, a city placed above
Thebes, there are zodiacs on the ceilings of two different
temples. That of the great temple, the entrance of which
faces the east, is upon two bands, which are contiguous
and parallel to one another, along the south side of the
ceiling. The female figures which embrace them are not
placed in the direction of their length, but in that of their
breadth, so that one lies across near the entrance, or to the
east, the head and arms toward the north, and the feet toward
the lateral wall, or toward the south, and the other is
in the bottom of the portico, equally across, and looking
toward the first. The band nearest the axis of the portico,
or the north, presents first, on the side of the entrance, or
east, and toward the head of the female figure, the Lion,
placed a little behind, and marching toward the bottom, the
feet directed toward the lateral wall. Behind the Lion, at
the commencement of the band, are two smaller Lions.
Before it is the Scarabæus, and then the Twins marching in
the same direction; then the Bull and the Ram, and the
Fishes close to each other, placed across upon the middle of
the band, the Bull having its head toward the lateral wall,
the ram toward the axis. The Aquarius is more distant,
and resumes the same direction toward the bottom as the
first signs. On the band nearest the lateral wall and the
north, we see first, but at a considerable distance from the
wall of the bottom, or the west, the Capricorn, which
marches in a contrary direction to the Aquarius, and is directed
toward the east, or the entrance of the portico,
having the feet turned toward the lateral wall. Close
upon it is the Sagittarius, which thus corresponds with the
Fishes and Ram. It also marches toward the entrance; but
its feet are turned toward the axis, and in a contrary direction
to those of the Capricorn. At a certain distance
before, and placed near one another, are the Scorpion and a
woman holding the Balance. Lastly, a little before, but
still at a considerable distance from the anterior or eastern
extremity, is the Virgin which is preceded by a sphinx.
The Virgin and the woman holding the Balance, have also
their feet toward the wall, so that the Sagittary is the only
one which is placed with its head contrary to the other
signs.
</p>
<p>
To the north of Esne is a small isolated temple, equally
facing the east, and having a zodiac also in its portico
(Great Work on Egypt, Antiquities, vol. i. Plate 87.) This
zodiac is upon two lateral and separated bands. That
which extends along the south side commences with the
Lion, which marches toward the bottom, or toward the
west, the feet turned toward the wall, or the south. It is
preceded by the Scarabæus, and the latter by the Gemini,
marching in the same direction. The Bull, on the contrary,
faces them, having a direction toward the east. But
the Ram and the Fishes resume the direction toward the
bottom, or toward the west. On the band of the north
side, the Aquarius is near the bottom, or the west, marching
towards the entrance or east, the feet turned toward
the wall, preceded by the Capricorn and Sagittary, both
marching in the same direction. The other signs are lost;
but it is clear that the Virgin must have marched at the
head of this band, on the side next the entrance. Among
the accessory figures of this small zodiac, must be remarked
two winged Rams placed across, the one between
the Bull and the Twins, the other between the Scorpion
and Sagittary, and each nearly in the middle of its band;
the second, however, a little more advanced toward the
entrance.
</p>
<p>
It was at first thought, that, in the great zodiac of Esne,
the division of the entrance took place between the Virgin
and the Lion, and that of the bottom between the Fishes
and the Aquarius. But Mr Hamilton, and MM. de Jollois
and Villiers, have supposed, that, in the Sphinx, which
precedes the Virgin, they found a repetition of the Lion,
analogous to that of the Cancer in the great zodiac of Dendera;
so that, according to them, the division would be at
the Lion. In fact, without this explanation, there would
only be five signs on one side, while there would be seven
on the other.
</p>
<p>
With regard to the small zodiac of the north of Esne, it
is not known whether some emblem analogous to this
Sphinx may have occurred in it, because this part is destroyed.&mdash;See

<p><a id="Footnote_382" href="#FNanchor_382" class="label">[382]</a> A remarkable fact of this kind is related by Salt, in his second
journey to Abyssinia. The Bay of Amphila, in the Red Sea, is formed,
he says, of twelve islands, eleven of which are in part composed of alluvial
matters, consisting of corallines, madrepores, echinites, and a
great variety of shells common in that sea. The height of these islands
is sometimes thirty feet above high water. The small island, which differs
from the eleven others, is composed of a solid limestone rock, in
which veins of calcedony are observed. Does not this small island, we
may ask, indicate that some cause has prevented the madrepores from
covering it, while they constructed their habitations in the neighbourhood,
on bases which probably must be of the same nature as those of
the small island?</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_383" href="#FNanchor_383" class="label">[383]</a> On glancing over the charts of Kotzebue’s voyage, we are struck
at seeing several of these islands grouped in a circular form, connected
with one another by reefs which appear to consist of madrepores, and
to present, by this arrangement, a small internal sea of great depth, to
which an entrance is afforded by one or more openings. May not this
arrangement be owing to submarine craters, on the edge of which the
lithophytes have erected their habitations?</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_410" href="#FNanchor_410" class="label">[410]</a> The remarks on the connection of geology with agriculture and planting,
are inserted here as an illustration of some of the details in the body
of the work. They will, we think, be useful to students of agriculture and
geology, and interesting to the general reader.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_411" href="#FNanchor_411" class="label">[411]</a> The dryness depends chiefly, if not entirely, on the fissures or divisions
in the rocky base of the soil; for, in some parts of Sologne in
France, as stated by Mr Arthur Young, and in sundry districts of England,
chalk and limestone bottoms are occasionally observed to be retentive
and wet. Undergrounds, formed of chalk or limestone, have
frequently a thin covering of vegetable mould, from their being, in some
cases, over close and wet, and in others over open and dry; the former
condition being unfriendly to vegetation and the formation of mould,
and the latter too readily permitting its departure when formed, or otherwise
favouring the decomposition and waste of that material.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_412" href="#FNanchor_412" class="label">[412]</a> The reason here assigned is confirmed by some observations delivered
by one of the latest and most intelligent of the English writers
on agriculture. “If,” says Mr Marshall, “the several strata”
(viz. the subsoil and base) “are of so loose a texture, as to permit the
waters of rains to pass quickly downward, without being in any sufficient
degree arrested by the soil, the land may be said to be worthless
to agriculture.” He adds, “Before we suggest any improvement
of lands of the latter description, it will be proper to premise,
that many of the light sandy soils of Norfolk, which would otherwise
be uniformly absorbed to a great depth, have a thin earthy
substance, or ‘Pan,’ which intervenes between the soil and the
subsoil, and which is of such a texture, as to check the descent of
rain waters, and thereby retain them the longer in the soil, as well
as to prevent the manure it contains from being carried away by
their rapid descent; yet sufficiently pervious to prevent a surcharge
of moisture from injuring the produce. To this fortunate circumstance
is principally owing the fertility of the lands of East Norfolk:
for wherever this filter happens to be broken by the plough, or
otherwise, the soil becomes unfertile, and continues to be so for a
length of years.”&mdash;(<em>See Norfolk</em>, vol. i. page 11.) “This fact aptly
suggests the expedient of improving, or fresh forming, a filter of
this kind; seeing how capable it is of producing so many valuable
advantages; the more especially, as it is probably the Norfolk pan
owes its origin to fortuitous art, rather than to nature.”&mdash;(<em>See Norfolk</em>,
vol. i. page 12.) “A millstone, or other heavy wheel-shaped
stone, made to run upon its edge, in the bottom of the plough-furrow
(the thickness of its edge being equal to the width of the furrow),
by the help of an axle and wheels, would greatly compress a light,
porous subsoil. The idea of forming a pan artificially, struck me
first in Norfolk; and time and experience have strengthened it. If
the experiment be made on a compressible subsoil, as sandy loam,
or the soft rubble which sometimes intervenes between an absorbent
soil and an open rock, there can be little doubt of its success. But
on loose open gravel, which is not sufficiently mixed with tenacious
mould to sheath it, and lying on an open base, less utility may be expected
from it.”</p></div>

Since that he has learned that a pair had been in use for a similar
purpose near Newcastle, county of Wicklow, until they were decomposed
by the action of the weather. There is also a specimen in

<p><a id="Footnote_436" href="#FNanchor_436" class="label">[436]</a> In England and Wales the following caves have been found to
contain fossil bones:
</p>
<p>
1. Cave in <em>Duncombe Park</em>, not far from that of Kirkdale. It
contains only recent bones.
</p>
<p>
2. Cave of <em>Hutton</em>, a village in Somersetshire, at the foot of the
Mendip Hills. Bones of elephants, horses, hogs, of two species of
deer, of oxen, the nearly entire skeleton of a fox, and the metacarpal
bone of a large bear, have been found in it.
</p>
<p>
3. Cave of <em>Derdham Down</em>, near to <em>Clifton</em>, to the westward of
Bristol. Bones of horses were found in it.
</p>
<p>
4. Cave of <em>Balleye</em>, near to <em>Warksworth</em>, in Derbyshire. In 1663,
teeth of elephants, some of which are still preserved, were found in
it.
</p>
<p>
5. Cave of <em>Dream</em>, at the village of <em>Callow</em>, near to <em>Warksworth</em>.
It was discovered in the year 1822, by some miners in search of lead-ore.
Nearly all the bones of a rhinoceros, in a good state of preservation,
were found enclosed in a bed of mud in this cave.
</p>
<p>
6. Fissures and caves at <em>Oreston</em>. These are in transition limestone.
Bones of the rhinoceros, hyæna, tiger, wolf, deer, ox, and
horse, have been found in them.
</p>
<p>
7. Cave of <em>Nicholaston</em>, near the coast of <em>Glamorgan</em>, in the Bay
of <em>Oxwich</em>. In the year 1792, bones of the elephant, rhinoceros, ox,
deer, and hyæna, were found in it.
</p>
<p>
8. Caves of <em>Paveland</em>, in the county of <em>Glamorgan</em>, between the
Bay of Oxwich and Cape Worms, at the entrance of the English
Channel. There are two openings in a cliff thirty or forty feet
above the level of the sea, which we cannot reach but at low water.
The clergyman and the surgeon of the neighbouring village of Portinan
found in them a tusk and grinder of an elephant; afterwards
other bones of the elephant, rhinoceros, horse, bear, hyæna, fox,
wolf, ox, deer, rat, of birds, the <em>skeleton of a woman</em>, and splinters of
bones, were also found. But many of these bones are modern; and
the diggings made at remote and unknown periods have displaced
the ancient bones, and mixed them with the modern, and also with
shells of the present sea.
</p>
<p>
Professor Goldfuss, in the 11th volume of the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nova Acta Physico-medica
Academiæ Cæsareæ Leopoldino-Carolinæ Naturæ Curiosorum</cite>,
published in 1823, gives an account of the fossil bones he met with
in the caves of Westphalia and Franconia. Speaking of the Cave
of Gaylenreuth, he says, that Esper has the following remarks on
the quantity of bones taken from these caves:
</p>
<p>
On first examination, there were collected, in a very short time,
in the dust of the floors of these caves, upwards of 200 different
teeth; and we may assume that, by the end of the year 1774, some
thousands were collected. It is difficult to form a conception of the
number of these zoolithes, and of the earth in which they are contained;
and I do not hesitate in believing, that, at the lowest estimate,
several hundred waggons load would not remove the whole.
The animal earth, with intermingled bones, was, in many places,
eight or ten feet deep. Esper calculated that, in his time, 180 skulls
had been taken out of the loose animal earth, the conglomerate not
having been broken up for this purpose. Of late years, the conglomerate
afforded, in the space of three years, 150 skulls; and we may
estimate that twice as many more were destroyed in breaking them
out of the hard stalactitic matter. If we add to this the pieces of
skulls which occur in this repository, more frequently than perfect
skulls, we may estimate that more than a thousand individuals lie
buried here.
</p>
<p>
These bones occur now, as formerly, irregularly dispersed; that
is, teeth, cylindrical bones, cranial bones, and vertebræ of different
species, and of different individuals of different ages, and of various
sizes, occur conglutinated together. We never find the under jaw
of the same skull near to it, and rarely the two separated portions
of the same lower jaw together; the skulls occurring all in the deeper
places: and Esper found the teeth forming a bed by themselves.
The bones still possess their sharper edges, and are neither rubbed
nor gnawed.
</p>
<p>
If we assume a thousand buried individuals, the proportion of the
different species will be, according to Dr Goldfuss, as follows:
</p>
<p>

1. Hyæna spelæa,        25<br />
2. Canis spelæus,       50<br />
3. Felis spelæa,        25<br />
4. Gulo spelæus,        30<br />
5. Ursus priscus,       10<br />
6. Ursus arctoideus,    60<br />
7. Ursus spelæus,      800<br />
</p>

<p>
The bones of small animals, mentioned by Esper, are now no
longer met with; and, in the collections of Esper and Frischmann,
Dr Goldfuss saw only a few dozen of the glutton (Gulo.) The
contents of a peculiar conglomerate described by Esper, cannot now
be determined. It consisted of a confused assemblage of very small
bones, the fracture surfaces of which were fibrous, and contained
also the thigh-bone and rib of a bird, which were conjectured to equal
in size those of the eagle; hence Esper inferred that the mass was
made up of the remains of reptile and fish bones.
</p>
<p>
No remains have hitherto been found in these caves; but in former
times we are told that teeth of the elephant were found in the
Zahnloch, and a vertebra, supposed, of a rhinoceros, in the Schneiderloch.
The bones of domestic animals, such as deer, roes, foxes,
and badgers, frequently found in the caves, shew, at a glance, that
they have come into their present situation accidentally, at a modern
period.
</p>
<p>
The cave at <em>Mockas</em> formerly contained in its deepest fissures,
teeth and fragments of bones of bears, associated with rolled stones,
and enveloped in earthy marl. The entrance to this cave is situated
on the acclivity of a hill. Goldfuss ascended to the entrance
of it by means of a rope, and found in its interior many narrow, wide
extended hollows, which are generally so confined that we can only
visit them by creeping. Here and there there are small widenings,
and frequently narrow outlets occur in the roof.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Zahnloch</em> and the <em>Schneiderloch</em>, which also contain single
bones of bears, are small vaults, with wide openings, into which we
can penetrate without difficulty.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_437" href="#FNanchor_437" class="label">[437]</a> The fact mentioned in the text brings to our recollection an
interesting Memoir of Professor Walther, entitled, “On the Antiquity
of diseases in Bones,” printed in Grasse and Walther’s Journal
der Chirurgie und Augenheil Kunde, viii. From eleven specimens
of bones of cave-bears found in the Caves of Sundwich, described
by Walther, a proof is obtained, that the common forms of
osseous diseases occur in them, just as they are observed at present
in the human species, viz. necrosis, anchylosis, caries, exostosis,
formation of new bony matter, thickening, thinning, and arthritic
properties of diseased bones. Most of those diseases are such as
would result from violent injuries, and the consequent very tedious
organo-vital reaction. Such mechanical injuries would give rise
to necrosis, caries, exostosis, &amp;c. We can easily conceive, says
Walther, how that the rapacious animals of a former world may
have been exposed to violent mechanical injuries of their bodies,
and of single parts of them. It is worthy of remark, that most of
the diseased bones are of the lower jaw, the alveolar processes of it
and the walls of single alveolæ. During the combats of the cave
bears for their prey amongst themselves, or with other gigantic animals,
the jaws and teeth must have experienced the greatest mechanical
injuries. The necroses of the humeral bones are such as
might result from a bruising of the bones, and the caries of the upper
surface of the bodies of the lumbar vertebræ, may have been
occasioned by external violence. Walther is also of opinion, that
the cave-bears suffered from diseases of the bones not referrible to
mechanical injuries. He remarks of a radius and a vertebra, whose
arthritic condition he carefully describes, “These bones have experienced
pathological changes, which could only arise from a long
continued diseased condition of the nutritive process. They are very
light, have an extremely thin crust, the greater part of their mass
is of a spongy, very porous substance, and are uncommonly fragile.
Such a change could not be produced by any external mechanical injury,
nor by any slight action of the weather; but must proceed
from a tedious constitutional disease, connected with a total change
of the organo-forming plastic activity, and proceeding from a peculiar
dyscrasia.” Hence it is probable, these cave-bears even suffered
from gout, scrophula, and other similar diseases.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
